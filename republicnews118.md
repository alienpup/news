## Daily Wireless Stories of the Sea Told by "Jack" Binns, Hero of the Republic

### Second Article in Series BINNS, THE "C. Q. D.' MAN The Wireless Operator Aboard Ship.

### Tells To-Day of Experiences in His Cage on a Great Ocean Liner and the Women Who Ask Questions.

### (Copyrighted, 1909, by the Press Publishing Company.) BY JOHN ROBINSON BINNS, The Republic's Famous  C. Q. D. Man.

A wireless operator must pet and caress his instruments even as a violinist tunes his strings or a chauffeur tests his engines. The spark-gap flashes of the wireless is the ocean song of electricity—the humming of the auto on land.

He is as helpless as a babe if he doesn't know every little device's condition. It's like a person out of sorts, only far more so. A fellow off edge can't work the limit, and the least bit of illness with any part of the wireless makes the whole system deathly sick and useless.

Going on a voyage is full of expectations. You know you have everything adjusted and really long before the big boat's horn announces you are out in the stream. To be sure you toy with it a bit as the gangplanks roll from the ship's side and a crowded pier is a waving sea of handkerchiefs and farewells. Once into the stream you telephone the captain "All's well" and stand by. You take up the 14x20 inch communication chart, furnished by the Marconi, indicating just where in the Atlantic you will pass incoming or possibly slower outgoing vessels.

### But That Is Only Routine.

These are the first routine matters. None of the fashionably dressed tourists have begun their wanderings about the decks to finally reach you and bombard you with questions a scientist couldn't answer. You're smoking your pipe or some of the ship's cigarettes, and, maybe, dreaming of an evening on land and a fair face who won you by her smiles. Or, maybe, you're thinking how many days and nights are before you until you'll see her on the other shore. The 'phone rings at your side. It's from the captain's bridge-- the only 'phone leading to the wireless room.

*Please say to office that Miss O' Hare, No. 143, lost her purse and tickets on dock!

It's the "old man’s” voice and you're well down stream.

It's the old story—some one always losing or dropping something. Sea Gate is near and you tell them. Maybe an hour after you get your first message.

“MKC, MKC, MKC (Republic). Purse found. Give her ship's best.''

It's a MSG (captain's message) and no one knows its contents but the skipper. Passing down below Sea Gate you say, maybe:

SA, SA. (Sea Gate), how's things? Gale coming. All well here. Had big time on Broadway this trip."

### On Liner's Last Trip.

We left New York that Friday alone. The chart showed us meeting the Baltic 160 miles east of Ambrose Light ship. I stood by the key until after two o’clock that morning to hail her, but got nothing. Then I lay down for a few hours until I should meet the New York about nine o'clock.

My nap was interrupted by the Florida. Then came the long tedious hours which, the newspapers persist, made me a hero. I did my duty, that's all, and expect nothing for It.

Usually you are quite out of the lime-light. You send a hundred messages or so all along the Atlantic coast to Marconi stations until well into the Atlantic and nothing happens to mould you into a hero, unless long hours and no sleep help to make one such.

Probably a day out a group of sweet faced young women saunter up to your wireless cabin on the upper deck and knock two or three times. It the sparks are flashing there's something doing and you can't run to the door. If not, you receive the passengers and while away some pleasant minutes. They want to know how it's done.

All are curious about the sparker and the big key and the swinging wires fixed to the mast and the chart, but I haven't run afoul of many who would ask the lonely operator if he's marred or now he likes the sea. But you have time, and they are pretty, and you like to have 'em around when you're not busy. You get it from all sides like this:

"Oh. Mr. Operator, won't you please tell us all about wireless? How's it worked? Where is Mr. Marconi now—isn't he a dear? What's this for and why does that spark jump? And, really, isn't it quite wonderful how you can talk to land? Now, isn’t it real Interesting?"

### Time for a Speech.

Your raised hand shows that you have enough queries to fully explain currents, waves, sparks, induction coils, aerials, batteries, dynamos and every invention In the world, and you finally stand back against the wall and make a scientific address something like this:

“Wireless telegraphy is not old—it's just twenty: young and ambitious, so to speak. In 1888, a German-Heinrich Hertz, a Bonn professor—found that electric oscillations, by disrupting dis- charges, went through space with the speed of light—186,500 miles per second. William Marconi, a. boy of twenty, heard of the Hertzian waves In the lecture room. Then he got busy.

"It was in 1894 that this youth sought to use the waves for signal purposes. He was successful. Then he went to London and sent messages a distance of two miles. Coming back home, his Government gave him two battleships to use for experiments, and he stretched it to twelve miles. When Sie. Marconi reported the yacht races in New York in 1839 he astounded the world. So you see, ladies, it has only been a process of stretching out imperialistic, so to speak, with scientific trimmings.’”

“My, how learned you operators are! But you haven't told us all. Say some more, won't you?”

### A Lecturer in Two Trips.

There's no way you can escape it. A wireless operator becomes a lecturer after two trips. But who can refuse a dozen pairs of cherry, pouting lips all wanting to know? The only chance to be excused is the click of my key. ‘MKC. MKC, MKC.' It doesn't come and that chat goes on. Here it is verbatim:

Well, my dear ladies, this is my nome. That key is my companion. That bunk is my bed and that volume of Shakespeare is the best friend I've got. We get calls and messages over this watch-case telephone receiver fitting to both ears. We send them by this big key—not like the ordinary telegrapher’s—but fitting In your hand like a handle bar. Thus we are the ear and mouthpiece for you all and the ship at sea.

"Through he spark gap, which makes the sharp electric reports—dots and dashes of the Continental code which wireless operators use—are sent out on wires 100 feet in length until they meet receiver. High speed in sending isn't necessary. The key must be firmly pressed down. You know the letter has gone into the air when you hear the sparks. Twelves words a minute is fast enough.”

That's enough of that side of wireless. The operator's cabin is five by eight feet, has a few pictures, a couple chairs and bunk and isn't attractive. The table across one side supports the wireless instruments. The aerial comes in through a window. Out on deck I point to the two masts supporting the crosstrees to which are attached the aerials. One wire leads down into my cabin. I show them the glass Insulators on the aerials and the insulators lower down and explain how the waves go out from the wires at right angles.

### Moisture Costs Energy.

I conclude much like this:

Successful wireless depends on perfect. Insulation, moisture such as the fog we ran into on the Republic may collect and cost us energy. It is the operator's duty to examine his aerials frequently. These wireless waves go much longer over the surface of salt than over the land and much better in winter than summer and more effectively at night than at day. The more aerials I have the further we can send.

I can send a message any place on the globe on board. Suppose I want to locate a ship in the Atlantic.  Even with all these liners crossing and recrossing it is easy to find the steamer wanted by the Marconi chart, which looks like a weather map full of lines. Assuming the message has been received at the Sagaponack station—the one this side of Siasconsett where Ginman got my ‘C. D. Q.’  cry for help for transmission to the Cunarder Umbria. He may find her several hundred miles away—out of his zone. But the New York is midway between Sagaponack and the Umbria. The operator signals the New York, and when he responds the message is relayed.

“We are bound to an oath of secrecy under Great Britain's laws with a penalty of a year's conviction, of $1,000 fine, or both. Of course, you hear talking all the way across the ocean, and often you are amused and—sometimes scandalized.”

## The Boy Hero, Or Words to That Effect.

(Within a few days, tortured public, the popular song writers will commit something like this—maybe worse.)

Two ships had met in awful crash and one was going down; It seemed as it that all or board was surely going to drown; But Binns, the boy operator, perched in his room so high, Stood at his post and to those folks these words did loudly cry:

CHORUS.

Don't be scared, for I am here;

Please don't go away from here.

I will bring help, for cannot you see

These messages I'm sending out;

They show I know what I'm about.

Now listen while I sound the CQD.

The hours wore on most wearily, but Binns was on the Job. And now and then some passanger would give a tearful sob; At last a boat came into view—it was the Florida— And Binns he lit a cigarette and these words he did say:

CHORUS

## WIRELESS.

The seas are deep and the seas are wide, and or ever the days of creatures were,

By sun and moon was pulled the tide and all the Earth was ocean-stir-

Then came land and then came beast and then came Man, and five feet high

Blinked his eyes on the churning yeast of a sea that melted in the sky.

Laughing the five-toot creature stood against the leagues on leagues of the deep—

Laughing he knotted a raft of wood and paddled his craft through hollow and steep—

But the seas are deep and the seas are wide, and they swallowed him down—and a host thereafter— Till nations came like a vast ebb-tide and went down cured of insolent laughter.

Nation by nation the daring came, with ribs of oak and with ribs of steel.

With wing of sail or heart of flame, but the great sea sucked them keel by keel—

TilI some escaped and some flew free, and mammoth greyhounds skimmed the deep—

Yet still the salt and dreadful sea was like a mastodon asleep.

But now comes the triumph of all the ages—the subject seas belong to Man—

They break his ship when the tempest rages, they bind his keel with the ancient ban.

But out through the big and blinding weather and the thick black log that chokes and smothers,

Man sends his cry through the infinite ether and calls to him his coursing Brothers.

Lo, at his call the mighty steamers turn them about with a word of love,

And deeds in the brains of ancient dreamers come real in flesh and live and move—

The Brotherhood gathers on gliding foam and with sandal-seas are their frail feet shod—

Man is making of Earth a Home, man is making of man a god.

Lo, we have taken the Earth's rough features and builded cities and civilizations—

Lo, we tiny sky-lost creatures are shadowed by our own creations—

Earth, that was but rough seas and sands, becomes a being with soul and heart—

Man is the Power of God with hands to build of Chaos an ordered Art!

Earth and the teeming fullness thereof is Man's: and in five-feet of clay

There is light of Dream and fire of Love enough to burn the skies away—

With every Labor the Soul enlarges—its depths are vaster than the sea—

We have not touched its starry images, nor guessed how godlike we may be.

Vast Eternities are before us with dreams and labors no soul may shirk:

Pure with the Glory divine that bore us we shall loosen God in us: set Him to work:

Unborn glories and grandeurs wait the releasing touch of a new creator:

The immense Creation of God is great, but the human spirit shall make greater.
