## Binns By Wex Jones

He isn't a hero booted and spurred;  
He hasn't a lance or a sword:  
He just sits at his post and passes  
the word, that's to save all the hundreds aboard.

Who is he?  
Binns, plain Binns.  
Talk about heroes,  
And Binns  
Just grins.

He isn't a soldier who swoops on the foe  
With a cheer and the promise of glory:  
He just sticks to His lob while the ship settles low  
And flashes the salvors the story.

And his name?  
Binns, plain Binns.  
Talk about glory,  
And Binns  
Just grins.

He isn't a picturesque person at all,  
To be spotted at once in a mob,  
But it's cheerful to know that whatever befall  
There's a fellow like Binns on the job--

That some Binns, plain Binns,  
Will peel off his coat when trouble begins.  
Talk of Binns,  
And America grins.

### Heroism and Dignity

To say, as several of our correspondents have, that John Binns, the wireless telegraph operator of the Republic, proved himself more a hero by refusing to exhibit himself for money than he did by sticking to his post on the sinking steamer, is wrong–by definition, as the mathematicians say. But there is no doubt that the refusal proved the possession of a much rarer, and in a way higher, quality than did the performance of a perilous duty.

Heroism, in spite of well-intentioned attempts to extend its meaning, is, as commonly and properly understood, largely a matter of accomplishment, and especially of accomplishment in the service of others. The chief difference between the hero and the ordinary man, who also happens to be a real man, is that the great opportunity to make his courage largely effective comes to the one and not to the other. Probably not one operator in the marine wireless service would have done less than Binns in like circumstances, yet it is not unfair that his name has gone all over the world, while that of the others remains unknown–as yet. Their turns may come in time, and then they will be heroes too, but for the present they must be content to earn their wages honestly.

In reusing to become an object of gaping and vulgar curiosity, Binns showed that he has the delicacy and dignity which not a few real heroes have lacked. Had he accepted the offers of the would-be exploiters and coiners of his fame, he would have remained as much of a hero as ever, but he would have been vastly less likable.

## UNIVERSAL LAWS FOR THE SEA

The Introduction by Representative James Francis Burke, of Pennsylvania, of a bill to compel all ocean-going passenger vessels to be equipped with wireless-telegraphy apparatus, and the attention the House Committee on Merchant Marine and Fisheries is giving to the same subject, is the first result of the notable illustration given by the collision of the Florida and the Republic of the supreme value of the latest aid in diminishing the perils of sea travel.

In addition, that disaster will serve to call attention to work that has been going on quietly for many years looking to the same general end. In the matter of collisions there is at least the beginning of a universal code in maritime law already generally adopted. The regulations of that code pertain to steering, sound signals, lights, etc., and while these have proved their utility, the inability of that code as at present interpreted to prevent collisions may be said to have been demonstrated. The first promulgation of these regulations was In 1864, an amended code was issued in 1884, and this again was modified and revised in 1897.

The confusion at present existing in the whole subject of maritime law is probably appreciated by none but those who have given the subject special study. There is, for instance, no uniformity regarding the time within which an acton for damages resulting from a collision can be brought. The preliminaries to such an action differ in different countries. Also when both ships are to blame there is a like difference as to the legal effects in different countries.

To remove these anomalies and differences and to bring order out of the present chaos has been for years the object of the International Maritime Committee. In recent years the four subjects of salvage, collision, limitation of ship-owners' liability and maritime liens and mortgages have been under examination and discussion. The first two of these, salvage and collision, were discussed at the diplomatic conference of October, 1905. The codes then submitted on these two subjects also received the approval of the conference called to meet at Venice last autumn. Conferences on maritime law have met in recent years in London, Antwerp, Paris, Amsterdam and Venice, and another called by the Belgian Government is soon to meet in Brussels. At the latter it is to be hoped a still more marked advance in the unification of maritime law will be made, and it is probable that we may at last have a universal code governing all over-sea traffic and travel.
