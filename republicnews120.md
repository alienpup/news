## Tells To-Day a Story of Love Along the Wireless Waves, When Cupid Sounds the "C. Q. D."

---

### Copyright, 1909, by The Press Publishing Co. BY JOHN ROBINSON BINNS, The Republics Famous “C. Q. D." Man.

The Kaiserin Auguste Victoria was bound for Hamburg. All morning I watched from my cabin window an endless chain of "baggage smashers" struggling up the plank with grips, trunks and bags of all sorts pressing into their shoulders.

It was the only trip I made aboard the Hamburg-American liner.

I was dreamily wondering how long--well, just thinking, when I was attracted by the loud laughter of a fashionable group ashore. I moved my chair outside the "cage."

It was half an hour before we sailed. A glance was enough to show that of the party, a line, vigorous specimen of a giant young American, was leaving. His smiles and nods were only half-hearted. He seemed depressed. Evidently the others were trying to cheer him up. He seemed to cling to the side of a tall, queenly looking girl, whose face was hidden under one of those big Parisian hats. There were eight in all.

### Visitors Ordered Ashore.

One of the chaps was telling a story: the girls were swinging their silk parasols and glancing shyly at the athletic fellow. It came time to get aboard and they were out of sight for some minutes. Then came the bells and the words “all but passengers ashore!”

As I sat the athlete youth brushed by me and stood on the upper railing. He was grinding his teeth and bravely fighting off an outbreak. Down on the pier were his friends again, with the beauty in the center. They were shouting cheers. His eyes were fastened on her. The the lines were cast off and we pulled into the stream. Far back on the dock with the little group waving handkerchiefs and parasols. Finally we were out of sight. The next time I saw him he was handing the tug captain a letter.

“‘Send it special, old man. as soon as you land, will you?’ he asked excitedly. We were probably out through Ambrose Channel when the door opened and the object of my interest stood abashed and half inside the “cage."

“Pardon me, do I intrude?” he asked. Messages from shore don't begin to come in until we get off the Sea Gate. I saw he was lonely and told him to make himself at home. He asked a lot of questions about wireless, how far it carried, if it ever went out of order, how soon messages usually are sent ashore and how long it likes to transmit them.

### Making Love by Wireless.

“Great scheme,” he exclaimed enthusiastically. I’ll have some for you. Could you send me one now?

It was addressed to young woman whose first name was Aida and read:

“**Off Sea Gate.**” **Every ripple of the sea and every wave of the air is burdened with my love for you**”

It was signed, but I can only give you the initial of his first name, “H.” He watched the spark gap echo the key’s contact. If his face and breath could have emitted Hertzian waves I guess those would have carried around the globe.

“Okay, oh follow," he continued when I told him the telegram was ashore and on its way, “you must have a great time here.”

I nodded. His face was rugged and built up from a massive and square chin and pointed nose. His eyes were blue and frank. It was easy to see he was making a trip against his will and would rather be ashore with her.

“Regular repository of the world’s  secrets, eh?” her remarked slowly. “Get ‘em all don’t you?” Well, you’ll know mine or know it already. Ever in love? No? Well it’s hell, old man. Got to settle some business for the governor in London—pressing, urgent, private—you know, and hard to tear away from—er—ahem—well, her, you see. It’s broke me up a bit. Met her at last big game. Why, banging out a three-bagger in the ninth or making ten yards in a close game isn’t in it with this thing. It’s got my goat.”

### Impatient for an Answer

Well, you see, I didn’t exactly what he was saying and for a second studied him closely. I gathered he was a college fellow and on business abroad for his father. He interrupted my thoughts with:

“Any answer yet?”

We were hardly at sea and only a few hours out from shore. He went [missing] I recieved several messages from Sea Gate in next few minutes, but none for him. ABour 4 o’clock he burst in.

Any messages? No? That’s strange.

He was greatly disturbed. Got up and sat down. Gazed wistfully back toward New York and then studied me curiously.

Maybe the wires are broken—I mean maybe eh—er—well, isn't something wrong with that?"

As he pointed to the spark gap there was a sputter: and I picked up my pen. A magician couldn't have done better. He jumped from the chair and saw me write his name and that of the ship. He was dancing all over the cabin. His eyes followed the words:

**" Take care of yourself, dear. Wear your heavy coat on deck. Don**’**t go too near the railing. Don't flirt or fight, will you? I miss you dreadfully. Been crying all afternoon. AIDA."**

He grabbed up the message, read it several times and sent her another:

**Don't cry, dearest. Wish I hadn't started. Whether fine. My overcoat's home. Wireless waves can't contain my love for you. Best to folks and your sister Alda."**

Before we got to Siaconset he had sent four more and received one, which read:

**Won't leave house until you return. Your chum, Harkins, here from Mexico. Sends best. Cheer up. Have you your deck slippers? “AIDA."**

Next morning he was up bright and early. We were by Siaconset and off Sable Island.

### After More Love Messages.

He tumbled into the cabin when was half dressed and asked nervously, *Anything for me?' He went away. but returned in an hour with the gloom all over his face. For two hours he made regular trips. He sent two to New York, one asking:

**"Can't eat without wireless. Feed the starving. Hurry. Gee, I love you, Aida.**”

About noon I got one for him. There was sone delay on land. for it was marked 9 o’clock. I sent the steward to get him. He came. hands out-stretched. Really, began to feel sorry for him, for he was such a  polite, cultured young gentleman and so badly smitten. The message read:

**“Spent evening with Harkins. Great entertainer. Wants to see you. Keep courage, honey; you'll soon be home. My love keeps. "AIDA."**

The reference to Harkins didn't seem to cheer him. and he quickly sent another message. Harkins, he explained, was an old pal who played end on his eleven In college and who had lived For years next door to that of his fiancee's home. The Harking boys and Alda and her sister were comrades from childhood, he said, and then suddenly a suspicion got the master hand in his wretched condition. He exploded.

“Wonder what in hell Dick Harking is doing there anyhow?” he said, and of he scampered.

### Shows Peevishness

Next two days he sent four messages and received two. Both were brief, asking if he was well. It was the fourth day out when the big lad became peevish. It had been raining during the night and communication wasn't clear. We had not met a boat in sixteen hours. He had sent one message, but hadn’t heard from her in twenty-four hours. He was broken hearted, wanted to climb the mast and examine the aerials and offered to do anything if I could only get “just one more message.”

**"Why no wireless? Please, Aida, hurry. I am dying with suspense. Don't execute me. H.”**

It was 6 o'clock in the evening. Many of the passengers, were at dinner and none were about the boat deck. His eyes were fastened wildly on the wireless apparatus. He finally became exhausted and sat with head drooping and dozing on a chair, Then came my ship's call. I wrote. It was addressed to him. I called him, figuring on relieving his suspense as quickly as possible. He saw me write his name and

**"Aida has eloped with’———**

I felt a clutch at my coat and then whirled about to see him leaning against the cabin door, his head buried in his arms. His whole frame shook. He was moaning as if struck by a hard blow. Then he cried aloud: *He won her: he won her at last!

### Had Eyes of a Madman.

His eyes were those of a wild man and he tore his coat and vest from his shoulders. I felt a creepy feeling stealing up my back and pressed a button under my arm, calling help. The rest of the message read:

**——“your chum. Can't find them.'**

It was signed the “G.” the initial of his brother's name. Well. help arrived just in time that day. The big fellow had fled from the cabin. I learned that three husky seamen had come just in time to prevent him tumbling into the sea. He raved and tore like a maniac, throwing the boat into terror and finally being forced Into Irons.

Two hours after the fatal telegram I was pondering over the fickleness of women and swearing eternal scorn when Cupid sent out the C. Q. D. of a lover's distress and rescued his subject from despair. The answer to Cupid's cry of distress was:

**"Aida ill in bed. Your telegram's best medicine. Alda's elopement shock to us all. Elopers in Chicago.”**

It was signed by the girl's mother. The thing stupefied me a minute. I read a copy of the other message and then this one; Something was wrong. Suddenly I became excited and rang for the steward. I was afraid that the poor fellow would go into convulsions and harm come to him If he got the second one suddenly. Finally the steward gave it to him. He was laughing fiendishly in the cafe and showing the effects of many drinks. He sobered instantly.

“Oh, God, what burden from my heart” he exclaimed. What”mistake, boys, and what it might have cost my dear old dad and mother and her. They've mistaken the letter ‘i’  in Aida's name for the ’l’ in her sister Alda’s Here, quick. rush this note to her."

### Danced With Joy.

He was brought up to my cabin, where he hugged me with joy, and I tell you I felt it too, for he meant it. He danced, slapped me on the back, ordered drinks, wanted me to eat with him, spoke to sailors,  shook hands all around and couldn’t stand still with joy. His wireless read:

**“Been slightly seized with attack chills. Recovery complete. Grieved over your illness. On land in two days and with you forever in two weeks. Cheer up, dear. H.”**

I then showed him a diagram of how the mistake was made. The Continental code reads:

ALDA (dit-dah dit-dah-dit-dit dah-dit-dit dit-dah)

AIDA (dit-dah dit-dit dah-dit-dit dit-dah)

The omission of simple dot and dash of the letter “L” made it read like an “I” and changed the "Alda” name into "Aida.” The story quickly circulated. He was demure and modest and usually spent his time with me. From over the waves he sought more messages, and they came—several in quick order. The girl got better, but we neared shore he became more impatient, and instead of remaining a week abroad he closed a deal for his father, lost something like $25,000 by his haste—he afterward told me—and was speeding for home on the first liner across. He's married now.

It was not Harkins, but another chum who ran away with Alda.

## \## (Article 2) Kidnapped From Jacks by Gen. Wood and Lionized at Army and Navy Club.

## WAS FORCED ON STAGE.

---

## ”Exhibited" at Hippodome

## \## Has to Run Kissing Gantlet of Pretty Girls.

---

Kidnapped by Gen. Leonard Wood from a party of friends in Jack's last night, hoisted into the banquet room of the Army and Navy Club as the guest of honor, forced on the stage of the Hippodrome, surrounded by four hundred flimsily dressed girls of all sizes and—must it be said— ages, and finally forced to run a kissing gantlet which took him to the brink of the stage pond, under the elephants’ quarters, and back and forth through a labyrinth of stage properties, are but a few of the experiences which “Jack” Binns, the hero of the Republic encountered in few hours last night.

"I'm bloomin' well tired of this sort o' thing," declared the modest young fellow today. *Why I don't understand it at all. I have a good mind to insist on getting a berth for the other side. Why should all this be? I don't enjoy it.

### Won't Go on Stage.

“One thing I wish the American people to understand positively. I will not under any conditions accept an offer to go on the stage and flaunt myself before the public for money, and I don't care how much they offer me. I am bothered to death with their offers. I don't want to go on the stage and won't I'm not an actor. I'm a seaman and I propose to return to my place in the wireless cabin.

"I will not appear or the stage under any circumstances in the future.”

Binns was the most important young one would wish to run afoul of last night. He declared it was unfair to force him on the stage at the Hippodrome, and so expressed himself when he reached the front of the stage. He was flanked on either side by his compatriots, the wireless operators of the Kaiserin Auguste Victoria and the New York, Lewis and Allen.

The continual adulations heaped upon him bored the British youth almost to the point of explosion. Once he became angered and exclaimed:

"I say mates. let us go back to ship. We'll escape all this sort of thing.”

### Taken from Friends.

This was uttered just as he emerged what the from the Army and Navy Club. Just young Englishman's impressions of Uncle Sam's officers is, couldn't be obtained, but the confused and mumbled jabbering of some of them as they squeezed his hand and told of the "blended" colors of the Union Jack and the Stars and Stripes, was irksome, he said.

Gen. Wood hailed Binns just as he reached the street. Above all. the Republic's wireless man is gentlemanly and considerate as was shown by the dozens of signatures which autograph collectors secured from him during the evening.

He turned when called. The army man pulled him by the hand through Jack's and into the club. He was quickly missed.

A dozen of his friends stormed the officer's citadel and sought Binns. They were told he was not there. Finally a major, more considerate and less exuberant, returned Binns to his friends. The unexpected and unexplained act of Gen. Wood broke up the programme of entertainment which his friends dad planned. It was considered quite proper by the officers.

## (Article 3) Some Shipwreck Thoughts

We are tempted to inquire what would have happened to Jack Binns, the wireless operator, had he shown any disposition to desert his post of duty when the Republic was sinking. Would not Capt. Sealby have handed him a wallop on the law? We wot in the affirmative.

Some of those rescued from the Republic yammered mightily because the transfer to the Florida was not made In upholstered steam launches and there were no steam-heated rooms with baths or roof gardens on the latter vessel. And yet these same kickers ride in the Subway every day.
