## Republic's Man Through All Kept Accord Perfect And Also *Saved His Juice!"

Mohawk at New Redford, the Seneca at New York, and boats we didn't think of like the collier Lebanon.

"As you know, the Gresham and Seneca finally got lines to the steamer.

Beside this land service we began sending for steamers we knew were due in our zone. The weather was so thick we were in doubt about some of them being on time. but we knew that we should pick up soon, or in a few hours, the Baltic, La Lorraine, the Furnessia, the New York and the Lucania, all bound west.

"The Baltic had passed west in the night, and was about off the east end of Long island. La Lorraine was eastward of the lightship. about 100 miles or 90, we thought.

### In Touch With Steamers.

"When we began sending out the distress call we didn't know who we would get first. In about 15 or 20 minutes we got La Lorraine. Her signature Is L L.

When we picked up that, we sent this message:

"Republic wrecked and wants assistance. Latitude 40 degrees 17 minutes north. Longitude 70 west.' La Lorraine gave us 'O K,' and repented our message to the Lucania, about 20 miles astern of her and out of our zone.

Our message to La Lorraine had been overheard by the Baltic, although we didn't know that at first, and she had at once turned back.

"La Lorraine tried to get the Republic, but couldn't, and at 7:50 we heard her again. She said: "Tell Republic we are 120 miles east of her and shall reach per about 1 p. m.' Not long after that La Lorraine got the Republic, and we had no more to do with her for awhile, as the Baltic had also got her, and they were exchanging messages.

"Both were racing for the Republic, in opposite directions. La Lorraine was coming up at 22 knots an hour, and her captain was sending frequent messages to the Republic.

"The Baltic was doing the same thing, but very often the ships had to work through us, as the weak sending on the Republic made it difficult for them to get what she said.

### Binns Saves His "Juice."

"We repeated a great many messages between the three. Binns was very brief, saving his juice' against the time when he might need it more.

"All day we were hearing the call 'LL' from the Lorraine and 'BC' from the Baltic, and occasionally the weaker 'MKC' from the Republic.

"For several hours we acted as relay between Lia Lorraine and the Baltic, keeping each informed of the position of the other. Samples of these messages would be like this:

'LL is steering so and so. What is your position and how are you steering?

From La Lorraine we also got this message:

Find out from M K C what depth of water he is in and on what kind of bottom.'

"That was how the French captain was gulling himself.

"The captains or the Baltic and La Lorraine could tell pretty well their distance from the Republic whether it was increasing or diminishing by the strength of the Republic's messages. It Its strength increased they knew they ware heading toward her.

"From time to time the Baltlc would send a message like this:

Our position is so and so–we are steering to scene of disaster with all speed. B. C.

### Republic Temporarily Silent.

"The Republic's wireless went out of commission temporarily about 6 in the evening Saturday when all hands left the ship because they thought she was going down. We didn’t get her after that until Sunday morning, when Binns got a board again.

"The Florida which rammed her took off her people, had no wireless, and that accounted for long gaps that occurred in the news of the wreck until the Baltic got along side the Florida and the transfer of passengers to her begin Sunday.

“We kept close tabs on that and forwarded the messages. We also forwarded 130 private messages from relatives of the Republic's passengers, and these reached them on the Baltic. We also received 98 from them.

"At the same time we were keeping tabs on La Lorraine. The last message we got from her was:

We are proceeding to New York under orders from Baltic to convoy the Florida.'

"La Lorraine couldn't find the Florida in the fog, and so kept on to New York.

"By that tine we were talking with the Anchor liner Furnessia.

"The Lucania and New York were also now in our zone, making their best speed toward Nantucket, and a little later Sunday we picked up the Atlantic transport liner Minneapolis.

### The Republic's End.

"Then we got a message from the cutter Seneca, saying she was 40 miles from the wreck. Next we heard from her saying she had reached the Republic and the Gresham had & line aboard, with the Furnessia acting as a drag, to steer her.

""The last message we got from the Seneca told the story of the Republic's end. It came in private conversation between our operator, E. T. Edwards, and the operator on the Seneca.

"Fifteen minutes later the official notice of the sinking of the Republic came from the Seneca, for transmission to Washington

## (Article 2) Diagram showing the scene of the collision, and the manner in which the aid of other vessels was brought to the stricken steamship by the use of wireless

UNDERNEATH a mesh of wires from which the electric flames spurted in streaks and flashes. Ginman, who operates the wireless station at Siasconset, a village on the south shore of Nantucket Island, sat at his work on the morning of January 23d. waiting for the dawn to break. From time to time the gossip and chatter of the big ocean liners came drifting over 8 radius of hundreds of miles of fog-bound sea.

It was quiet in the little shack upon the spit of sand that runs out into the Atlantic. Nothing broke the monotony of the night except the distant pounding of the breakers, the wind that Sang through the wires overhead, and the steady, uninteresting click, click of the chattering ships. Then, suddenly and unexpectedly; cutting through the air came the three letters C. Q. D. the signal made by some ship in distress at sea. (C. Q. stands for "all ships." D. means distress. It was a notification to transmit the distress signal to every vessel within two hundred miles of Siaseonset.

Ginman waited. The chatter of distant ships clicked off meant nothing more now than the noise of the wind or the pounding of the sea. A few seconds afterward the message came:

We were struck by an unknown boat: engine-room filled: passengers all safe; can stay afloat; latitude 40.17. longitude 70. Republic.

It was the big, four-year-old White Star ocean liner that was in distress. She had sailed from New York on Friday, carrying a full complement of passengers for the Mediterranean--wealthy Americans upon their wav to their winter residences, and returning immigrants. She was rammed amidships in the thick fog of Saturday morning, by the Italian Lloyds emigrant ship Florida, heading for New York. On the two ships one woman and five men were killed and two men injured. They were those whose staterooms or sleep-in berths were it the point of the collision. The Florida stood by, in spite of a smashed bow, and received on board the 700 passengers of the Republic: later, her own condition being precarious, the sixteen hundred souls aboard her were transferred to the Baltic, which carried them to New York in safety. After heroic but fruitless efforts had been made to save the Repullic she sank.

That these sixteen hundred-odd lives were saved due entirely to the marvels of wireless telegraphy. It was robbed accident by sea of half its terrors. No longer need the passengers of a wrecked ship scan the horizon hopelessly while the sea pours into the hold and inch by inch, Death gains his footing. For an invisible network of ethereal communications unites ship to ship; and from the station of the Marconi operator help can be called for and assurance of safety received. Truly, in the words of Longfellow' sea captain, heaven: is as near by water as by land.' Man has half conquered the evil genius that lurks upon the face of the waters.

In the transmitting room of the Republic Binns, the Marconi operator, sat, calmly tapping a key at the dictation of the captain. Outside, the passengers ran through the wrecked ship, whose engine rooms were flooded; there were the multitudinous sounds of fear. Was the vessel sinking? Was the unknown ship that had rammed her standing by? Nothing was visible in the night: and if it had been day the Florida wont have been hidden in the fog. But inside the transmitting room Binns sat, calmly ticking off the message that was taken down almost instantaneously at Siasconset.

The wires above Ginman's head began to catch the reply to his signals. First Charleston Navy yard called promise of aid: then in succession came word from Newport, Boston. Wood's Hole, and Vineyard Haven. From Wood's Hole the revenue cutter Acushnet went to the rescue. The revenue cutter Gresham sped out from Boston. The cutters Mohawk and Seneca caught the distress signal and they cruised along the coast and started away. Then came another mesage from Binns, still at his post in the transmitting-room aboard the Republic:

Able to keep afloat: engine-room full." The Baltic and the Lucania caught the C. Q. D. signal later in the day, From every point rescuing ships were converging toward the shattered Republic. Somewhere in the thick for La Lorraine came steaming toward the New England shore.

"Am going to the rescue of the Republic, which sinking off Nantucket," called Captain Tournier, heavy fog. Cannot go to her right away, as we have to take our hearings at noon a message from Captain Warr, of the Lucania, was flashed at Siasconset, and thence transmitted to New York, to be posted at the Cunard offices in State Street

"Sixty-five miles east of Nantucket. Hope to reach Republic at 4 P.M.

Would the rescuers reach the sinking vessel in time? Power off: have to use storage batteries, the last message that had come through from [missing] With the flooding of the engine-room a off of the power that drove the dynamos [missing] substitution of the transmission of wireless messages, the radius of communication was shortened by half. People were waiting in New York, waiting through a deep, impermeable silence that had wrapped itself around the Republic. She had ceased to signal. Had she gone down, or were her storage batteries too weak to carry to Siasconset!

Soon after noon the tension was relieved. A message came through from the Baltic, via Siasconset. where Ginman still sat waiting in his shack. The Baltic was almost at hand: the Republic was still afloat, and her passengers had been transferred in safety aboard the Florida during the middle of the forenoon. Through the dense fog she came, forging her way as swiftly as she dared over a dead calm stretch of water. Even when near enough to hear the deep, measured booming of the Republic's submerged bell she could see nothing: only the messages of Binns that came from the transmitting-room kept the rescuers informed. At eight o' clock in the evening Captain Ransom, of the Baltic, sent a message directly to New York. The damaged vessels were still afloat.

Now the veil had been lifted. AlI were aware that through the power of wireless telegraphy- and. of course, the heroism of Binns in staving at his post some seven hundred passengers had been saved from death. At nine o clock word came that the Republic had been abandoned. When she went under, Captain Sealby and an attendant officer, who had refused to leave, flung themselves into the sea and managed to keep afloat on a rail until picked up.

On Monday evening, sixty hours after the collision, the Florida arrived under her own steam at this port. One of her holds was filled with water, that her water tight compartment system had kept her afloat. It is believed that will be impossible to salve the Republic, which is sunk in thirty-eight fathoms of water.
