## Wireless Hero of the Republic Who Has Won Fame With Signal "C. Q. D."

## WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY

It has always been the lot of the human race to advance through distress and disaster to brighter life and better conditions. It took the disaster of the White Star steamer Republic to demonstrate to the world the enormous value of wireless telegraphy for the safety of ocean travel.

Marconi in 1896 produced the first wireless telegraph capable of sending and recording electric waves across long distances. In that year he could send intelligible messages 200 feet. By 1900 he had perfected the process so as to be able to transmit messages 200 miles. In 1902 his ship, the Carlo Alberto, kept in touch by wireless with a station on the coast of England at distances up to 2,300 miles. In December of that year wireless messages were exchanged between England and Canada. In 1907 a regular trans-Atlantic wireless service was inaugurated.

There can be no doubt that in face of the service Marconi wireless telegraphy—the only wireless service that so far has proven its practicability and efficiency—on last Saturday, when the wireless messages of distress brought to the disabled Republic five ocean liners—every ocean-going vessel will hasten to provide itself with wireless instruments for intercommunication and co-operation. Travelers after the last experience will hardly be willing to go on steamers that are not fitted out with wireless telegraphy. The accident off Nantucket should mark a new and prosperous era in the development of the Marconi wireless telegraphy.

## C. Q. D.

Anybody who has been at sea knows how big the ocean is and how small the ship. Also how lonely is the watery plain. As we sit at home and glance down the record of shipping news, with its daily tale of hundreds of ships plying (as we think) like ferryboats on the ocean highway (as we say), the mental picture is of a closely settled neighborhood of ships in a world of blue; something like the cheerful advertising posters sent out by the steamship companies; in these pictures there are always plenty of ships in sight of each other.

What has often happened, has happened again. A great floating bulk of steel, its power of propulsion and direction suddenly gone wrong, carrying a thousand human beings, wallows alone, helpless, in a fog. No lookout can see where the ship is drifting; no flag signal can be seen by any passing craft; no steam whistle can surely be depended upon to bring help. However big and stanch and well manned the ship, she is alone and unseen in the universe; relatively as fragile as a rowboat in summer gale upon a lake, out of sight of land.

Until our fortunate time in the world, this has been absolutely true. The ship going to sea has swung off into isolation as a man lets go his life and swings off into an unknown country during sleep. He will probably wake; the ship will probably come to port. But meanwhile they are cut off. 

But not now. Through the agency of Marconi's invention, the ship at sea can call through fog and storm. No longer is she an individual who must take her own chance of life every time she goes to sea. The resources of civilization and invention have been so broadened as to take her in. The steamship Republic sailed from this port with 500 passengers for a pleasure cruise in the Mediterranean. She was disabled during the first day out, and lay helpless off the Island of Nantucket. But her Marconi operator sent up the ship hailing sign of distress, the letters CQD, CQD, CQD, CQD—straight up into the gray hollow overhead like a flock of carrier pigeons. One message went straight to the Revenue Cutter Gresham, off Cape Cod. At once the Gresham steamed at full speed to her help. Another message found the steamship Baltic, another found the steamship Lorraine; all of them started instantly to the assistance of the rammed and sinking Republic. Later wireless dispatches received here say that the help came in time,and every person was taken off the Republic by the ships to whom Marconi's call of CQD came dropping through the empty air. 

Wireless telegraphy has been hailed marvel of science, but [what] the service has done humanity today sets it far higher people's minds. It will hereafter be considered as indispensable a part of any steamship's equipment of safety as her charts or her navigator. It is the steamship's invisible life line, by which the safety of her passengers is regarded in a degree which no traveler of ten years ago could have dreamed. It is the best of modern magic.

## GREAT WIRELESS FEAT.

When, on Saturday morning early, forty miles out at a small steamship ran into and punched an ugly hole in the side of a greater steamship with five hundred people on board, the world knew of the disaster in a few minutes. The man at the wireless key on the damaged steamship gave a few clicks on his instrument. He sounded the marine code meaning danger and distress. Then a wireless man on shore, on Nantucket, caught the signal, and all other business of the wireless was suspended. From the shore was sent a general alarm to all vessels within a radius of two hundred miles, and it was not long before replies were received from two or three boats some of them one hundred miles distant, saying they would go to the scene of trouble. And the man at the key on the damaged vessel—the Republic of the White Star line—sat at his desk. He kept the people on shore, and thus the people throughout the world, informed as to the condition of the ship, and before he got through it was sent out that everybody had been taken from the ship in safety; and three or four government cutters were hastening to the scene. The vessel that had run into the Republic was damaged on its prow, but it managed to get near the Republic and rescue those on board. By this time another ocean steamer had reached the scene and others were close at hand, while a revenue cutter from a Massachusetts port had reached the Republic. But all danger to life was ended. And the damaged vessel was, according to the reports, able to keep afloat, while the Florida, which had caused the accident as the result of the heavy fog, started for New York guarded by another steamship.

What is of deep concern to those who travel on the sea is the fact that a few minutes after the collision other ships were told of the mishap, the people on shore knew it, and all suspense was relieved by the constant flashes sent from the Republic. It was a most remarkable illustration of the effectiveness of the wireless system. The mishap occurred only forty miles from shore, but it might as well have been two hundred miles. Fortunately the damage inflicted did not sink the Republic and, equally fortunate, the Florida was not put out of service. Even if both boats had gone down the chances are that the people on shore would have known of the tragedy and succor would have been possible for the survivors.

Wonderful as was the first use of the telegraph lines on shore, and later the Atlantic cables, their achievements were nothing compared with the wireless system used by the ships. By it use it was possible to tell other boats afloat that their services were needed, while those on land knew in a few minutes the extent of the mishap. And, by means of the wireless on the boats which caught the signals, it was possible to distribute the news throughout the entire route followed by the Atlantic steamers, by means of relay messages. The wireless system, and the man at the key on the Republic did great work on Saturday, aided by the man at Nantucket, who knew (unreadable).
