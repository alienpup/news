## Operator Describes How President-Elect Tait Learned the Mysteries of ' Q. D." and the Wireless Wonders

(Copyright, 1909, by the Press Publishing Company. New York World) BY JOHN ROBINSON BINNS, The Republic’s  “C. Q. D." Man.

ONE of the pleasant memories mans trips acmes the Atlantic the privilege of acting as the President-elect’s tutor in chief in when he was rounding the last leg of his famous trip about world a year ago: We became very friendly, and I may be pardoned for expressing the opinion that Mr. Taft is well versed in the marvels of the Herzian waves.

The Kaiserin Augusta Victoria had just tied up after my any trip with her when got orders to return at once on the President Grant, about to depart with the then "Secretary of Peace. There wasn't Anything unusual for a day out. The operator's "cage" not as well apportioned as on some of the big liners, but the instruments were recently Instilled and the ship's system was at excellent one.

Expecting the big Secretary to visit the cabin, I had spent several hour's arranging the interior of the "coop" and testing and tuning so that there should be no flaws when Mr. Taft visited the "house." He came on the second day Out.

### Mr. Taft Appears.

Several messages for the captain had reached me, four of them giving descriptions 'of persons wanted’ by Scotland Yard. I was ready to ring the steward's bell when a shadow fell across the door. I had heard that Secretary Taft was one of the biggest men in the United States and instantly stressed that, like other great events, he was casting his shadow before him. I arose, stepped quickly to the door, and, sure enough, there he was, smiling a greeting with the remark:

"Good morning. sir; you're the wireless man, aren't you??

I bowed, replied that I was, and invited him Into the "cage.' He squeezed through the door. Then he looked at me sort of puzzled. and I confess I was facing an enigma, too. There were no chairs about sufficiently built to accommodate him. He Saw my discomfiture, opened wide his mouth in a hearty laugh and squatted down almost Instantly to the side of my bunk. I waited for an accompanying crash, but it didn't come. Then I made myself comfortable again. I sent two messages for him.

### Gets a Message for Taft.

As he sat there discussing the distance the ship's system would carry, sot the boat's call. It was a message relayed from New York and came very faintly. The sparks began to fly as I gave the return flash and the Secretary sat there. his eyes glued to the receiver about my ear. The message was for him. As I began to write. I said:

"This is for you. Mr. Secretary,"

“Well, well, you don't say. And from whom? What is the matter now?"

There was some Irritation In his voice. He spoke as it he half expected to receive advices to go into some other corner of the world and scatter the doctrine of love and good will toward mankind. Anyhow, he patiently waited until I had it written.

His severe mien at once vanished and in its place the uh seemed to come again it was a wireless from a York news so: a for a statement on the Philippines. He folded the message and placed it in his pocket, remarking:

“Can’t escape ‘em. There used to be a place where a fellow was safe from the newspapers but wireless links the deep blue sea with the devil, and there's no betwixt any more.

### Taft Learns the Code.

Then he laughed again, and finally remarked that “boys are a good set anyhow" and sent along a short statement. This done, we had plenty of time to chat. I explained the Continental code system and the meaning C. Q. (all ships) and of the now world-wide “C. Q. D.” I told him of a  “C. Q. D.” joke which acted acted like a mule’s kick on the perpetrator, who was myself. It was like this:

I was sent out one day with a green operator. He was a regular young Rip Van Winkle. Sleep? Why, only when he was eating was I convinced that he was awake. had been up for twenty-two hours steady on heavy commercial business when I first shipped with Marconi. Before retiring I Impressed upon his mind the meaning of the code "C. Q. D.,' saying that seconds were ages in a case like that, and that quick judgment often averted a horrible sea disaster.

Before retiring I arranged the tape so that it would print "C. Q. D.” a dozen times as soon as the "cub" would sit down. I had quickly fallen into a heavy slumber. It was probably ten minutes after that I was rolled out of my bunk on the floor, felt a pail of water deluging my face and clothes and some one shaking me much as a terrier handles a doll baby. I was as sore as a hornet.

### Joke Turned on Binns.

I Jumped up, wiped my face, whirled about like a howling dervish and was about to plant feet and hands all over the thoughtless youth when my eves met his.. He was shaking and trembling. His hand pointed to the tape. His eves were wild and fixed on mine. I saw he was speechless. I ran to the tape, and saw a long line of paper bearIng the letters *C. Q. D, C. Q. D., C. Q. D.”

Hall asleep still, I tumbled Into the chair now thoroughly imbued with the fellow's terror and forgetful entirely of my attempted Joke. He stood over me like a fiend shouting in my ear:

“Quick Jack, give him an answer — he can't be far away. Hurry, man, for God's sake. don't lose a second.

In a jiffy I was bombarding the air with Hertzian waves. It must have been fully a minute before I awoke sufficiently to realize that the joke was on me. Well, I you could have seen the President-elect laugh. Of course, there was no accident, but I didn't explain to the young fellow, and to this day he believes that some freak of wireless brought that call.

Mr. Taft Inspected each of the instruments, listened to the dots and dashes of a message which we received in another ship's zone. and asked me of myself and my experiences. He seemed particularly interested in the story of the six months I put in at Crookhaven. near Clifton. on the southwest coast of Ireland, where the big transatlantic station Is located.

### Taft Hears of a Hero.

At Crookhaven we were fifteen miles from the nearest tramway, thirty miles from the nearest railroad, and when we wanted a hair cut we had to go eighty five miles for it. I told him of Florence McCarthy, who won the British Royal Society's medal for life-saving. McCarthy was a sort of an anti-land-lord man and, hoping it's not less majesty. I didn't blame him. McCarthy rescued a whole boatload of sailors from a whaler off Fastnet Light, eight miles from land, when big steamboats refused to venture into the raging sea.

The sea was rolling over them and everyone expected not to see them engulfed McCarty, as the rocks on the and as courageous as a lion, chose his crew of hearties—all would go to the ocean’s bottom for him—and out they went one morning after kissing their families good-by on the shore. They came back, but man has never seen nor has painter depicted such a rescue.

### ”Well Done," Said Taft.

“Well, done. McCarthy ' shouted: the President-elect exultantly at this point clapping his hands and slapping me on the shoulders. Well, we talked of other things that day, and from time to time I would take a message. Usually I was met with the query:

“Urgent, Jack?”

His smile was 50 contagious that quite frequently found myself laughing with him. He's a bully gentleman and will make a President that Americans may look to with pride. He has dignity, democracy and a rave understanding of man well combined in his make-up. The trip to New York was without Incident. We shook hands and he left.

## ”But," He Says, "Jack Binns is The One to Write Up."

## Republic's Man Through All Kept Accord Perfect And Also "Saved His Juice!"

---

"The greatest hour In my right years of wireless service was be tween 6 and 7 last Saturday morning, when we were trying to get messages through the air to ships that could help the Republic."

The speaker was A. H. Ginman, head operator at the Marconi station at Siasconset, on the far side of Nantucket. He and his mates had formed the sole and making link in the wireless chain the sinking steamer and possible rescuers, Through Siasconsot passed the first important messages that told the Baltic and La Lorraine, both outside the wounded Republic’s wireless range, of the danger of the 700 and more souls on board the White Star liner. The world did not know then, and learned only through the wireless some hours later, that the Italian steamer Florida, which had caused the disaster, was standing by.

## THE MAGICAL PART.

In the drama of the sea thus be- gun, which lasted 40 hours and ended with the sinking Sunday night the Republic when in tow of ships summoned by wireless, and the landing a few hours later in Now York of her passengers from another ship that also had been called to her aid by wireless, the greatest chapter in the history of a modern marvel shaped itself.

In this chapter important chapter were Ginman and his mates of Slasconset, the faithful and. hard-working operators of this farthest seaward station or the American coast, through whose vigilance the first faint word from the Republic was plucked from the air and repeated, to shift the helms of a dozen rescuing craft and tater to ease the anxiety of thousands who had friends among the passengers on the Republic.

For the first the the wireless had shown on a scale that could not be ignored its possibilities for humanity.

## "BINNS," HE SAYS.

"You will excuse me." said Ginman.

“If I don't tell you a very clear story but you see I haven't slept for about two days and nights, and think I need a nap.

He had left the station at Siasconset and was in a Boston hotel, due to sail today to England, his native country, for a holiday. Mrs Ginman and their kiddie were with lim.

“I’m sorry my vacation begins now, said the man who had charge of the wireless that saves lives. “I’d like to have staid at the station until it was all cleaned up.

“Jack Binns of the Republic is the man you want to write up,” insisted modest Ginman.

But Ginman was persuaded to tell what happened at Siasconset between 6:10 Saturday morning and 10:30 Sunday night.

“I have never heard of anything like this," he said, “in the wireless game, either in the amount of work done, the rapidity with which it was done or the importance of it. Between 7 o’clock Saturday morning and 10 o'clock Sunday night we must have handled good deal more than 20,000 words. There were dozens and dozens of regular messages. besides all the talking going on between ships and shore, and the relaying we did between ships that couldn't reach each other direct.

“You see we were nearer the Republic than any of the ships that went to her help. She was about 47 miles from us. When she first sent out her distress call the Baltic was about 89 miles from her, to the west, and the Lorraine 120 miles to the east."

### What Happens at Siasconset.

The station at Siasconset stands on the moor about a quarter of a mile from the string of summer cottages that line the beach. on the southeast tip of the island.

There are two wood staffs, 180 feet high. and near them is a house in which are three rooms. operating, engine and traffic or clerical room. Some distance away is the house in which the operators. four in winter and five in summer, have their residence.

There is always some one on duty in the operating 100m. the double telephone receiver over his head, adjusted to each ear so that the faintest tick from the hertzian waves can be "picked up."

“I was at home and asleep Saturday morning." continued Ginman, “when J. R. Irwin who had the last night watch, came to my door and called me. He came off duty a little after 6.

“ ‘We've had C Q D from the Republic’ Irwin said. 'She's been run down and wants help: Guess their juice is pretty low: I could barely hear them.’“

It should be here stated that the letters 'C Q D' form the distress signal at sea, whether by flag or wireless.

“The call had come at the dullest tine of night, when we get hardly anything from the land, and only an occasional message from the ships passing east and west of the European lines. We had heard the Republic in our zone, to the westward, about 10 o clock Friday evening, but had made no particular note of her."

### Messages for Republic.

In his first message Saturday morning alt the operator on the Republic sent out was C Q D, repeated over and over, with his position, and the ship's signature, M K C.

“Irwin had answered, 'O K will rush help, adding S C. which our code signature. This showed the operator on the Republic that he had a land station. In about 10 minutes this message came out of the air from the Republic.

“‘We have been smack by an unknown steamer, engine room full, passengers safe M. R. C.

“Irwin knew the cutter Acushner was at Woods Hole. We have a direct wire there, and he put a message on it before calling me.

“We then got the White Star office, and they and the navy people, who reached through Woods Hole, started up the cutter at various ports, like the Grisham at Provincetown, the cutter
