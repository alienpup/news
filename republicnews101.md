### WHERE THE COST COMES IN.

“I shouldn’t wonder it they did try to do it.” said Frederick Minturn Sammis, chief engineer of the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company, today. “You would be surprised if I were to tell you some of the companies with whom we have been conducting negotiations recently- negotiations which can end only in our getting a reasonable rental or in the removal of our Installations from their ships. They are thoroughly modern and up-to-date companies, too, of unimpeachable reputation so far. Yet they have plainly indicated that, rather than agree to our demands, they will de without our system.

Our demands are not exorbitant. All we ask is that we shall be protected from less. We'll be satisfied with anything that does that for us. Perhaps. to illustrate our position, few figures will prove worth while. In the rush season, during the summer months, especially, we generally manage to make expenses all around, and sometimes we do big business. The German boats are the best payers. Sometimes we take In $600 on a run to and from Europe, The big Cunarders pay too. I can't explain why it is that the German boats pay best, but they do.

“When We make $500 in the course of a run, we are lucky. All the expense to us out of that is the salary of the operator and his assistant. On the other hand, when the tide of traffic has fallen off, we often lose money on every voyage. When the New York came in yesterday with nineteen passengers in her cabin, do you suppose we made anything on the trip? Not a cent. We lost $15 or $20, and we'll lose as much more on her run back to England.

"On the majority of the liners, we lose money most of the year. That doesn't seem right to us. It wouldn't cost the company a large sum to insure us against loss, and they must know now, if they didn't know before. how valuable the wireless is. One thousand dollars a year for each vessel would suit us. That would allow us about $60 for each round trip made, and would just cover us from possible loss.”

Steamship men say that the Republic disaster has emphasized the need of some universal code of communication regardless of the particular system. Rivalry between telegraph companies, it is pointed out, makes this last Impossible.

### ACCORDING TO EMIL BOAS.

According to Emil L. Boas, resident director and general manager of the Hamburg-American Line, the existing arrangement is the cause of much confusion. Mr. Boas is also firmly convinced that all transatlantic ships which carry passengers are in duty bound to be equipped with wireless apparatus

“The time is bound to come,” declared Mr. Boas this afternoon, “when all vessels will take it up. Of course, at the present time, most of the large ocean liners do make use of the system, but It is not universal.

I think steamships with passengers aboard should be compelled to maintain a wireless station and operator. The thing has become a necessity, as the recent collision has clearly shown.

Then there is the other question which seems to me equally Important. In our company, for instance, we have to patronize two wireless telegraph concerns. Our Atlas service, going between New York and the West Indies, is equipped with the United Wireless system, while our transatlantic ships use the Marconi system.

“Now these rival systems do not work together. You can imagine the inconvenience that results. Here is a case to illustrate:

### A CASE IN POINT

Not long ago we took the Biucher out our transatlantic service and sent her into Southern waters. Speaker Cannon was on board and had made special arrangements to keep in touch with Washington. But, you see, the Biucher was equipped with the Marconi system and the operator refused to communicate with stations belonging to the United Wireless.

“Strangely enough, the operator In question was Jack Binns, who had charge of the Republic's station. I don't Blame him for refusing: he was merely working under orders. But plainly such conditions should not prevail. The companies ought to work together. They ought to be made to do so, by law, if necessary.

Gustave H. Schwab, New York agent of the North German Lloyd, added his opinion to that of Mr. Boas.

"Not only should all ships be provided with wireless, said Mr. Schwab, but there should be a universal system aa well. I am strongly In Favor of It. There is no reason why the different telegraph companies should refuse to accept each other's messages.”

Officer’s of the Cunard Line were not so strong in their opinion, although it was admitted that the suggestion had many advantages.

It was pointed out that the smaller passenger lines would have few occasions to make use of the wireless system, and that situations where it would be of real service would be exceedingly rare.

At the offices of the United and Marconi Wireless Companies, it was explained that in cases of emergency, orders were to accept all messages. This was done in the case of the Republic.

### UNITED WIRELESS WILLING.

Offers of the United Wireless Company declared that they were willing to enter into an agreement with their rivals whereby messages should be received at all times, irrespective of the company which sent them. But this the Marconi Company refused to do. John Bottomley, general manager of the Marconi system, explained that the other companies were regarded as imitators, who had sprung up later, and could not be recognized by his concern.

The only time when we will accept their messages," said Mr. Bottomley, "is in case of distress. Then, all barriers are for the moment, overlooked. If a ship is in danger, or if there has been an accident, her appeals for aid would certainly be received and answered, no matter what system she used. But otherwise, we will have nothing to do with our rivals."

C. C. Galbraith, assistant superintendent of the United Wireless, said that operators on this system would receives messages sent by the Marconi people, or in fact any other company. "We are agreeable to any arrangement," he added, whereby a universal system could be established provided the tolls were equally distributed."

## FLORIDA HERE; HAS THREE DEAD

### A Fourth Likely to be Added - Eugene Lynch of Boston May Not Survive.

### CAPTAIN'S STORY CUT OFF

### Starts to Tell It, but is Interrupted, and Officials Stop an Officer's Narrative.

### BOW A MASS OF WRECKAGE

### Smashed Almost to the Bridge, and She Comes Up the Bay Stern High Above Water.

With thirty feet of her bow cut away and tilting forward at so perilous an angle that she seemed about to dive into the depths of the harbor, the Italian steamer Florida, of the Lloyd Italiano Line, which ran down the White Star liner Republic last Saturday morning near Nantucket, moved slowly and wearily into port yesterday afternoon a few hours behind which brought the passengers of both ships. Crippled she was and exhausted, but she had come under her own steam from the scene of the disaster, the quiet smiles on the faces of her skipper Capt. Raspini, and his officers told they were proud of their amazing feat, which was accomplished without any aid whatever.

Seen from a distance, the forward tip of the Florida seemed to be actually flush with the water, so much was the damaged vessel tilted. At her halyards between the masts were the “Not under control” signals, black and grim, while her flags, half masted, told of a dead sailor lying, shrouded in white, in the Florida's hospital, and of two other dead seamen, jammed and smashed of all semblance to humanity in the chaos of broken, snapped wood and iron which had been the Florida s bow.

The Florida passed Sandy Hook at 2:20 P. M. and began her painful course up the channel toward her haven of refuge at the Italian line pier in Brooklyn. As she crept along tug alter tug steamed out to her until her course became a triumphal progress. Two of the tugs promptly tied up to her just aft of her crushed bow and began slowly to help her along. Up to that moment since the accident the wounded liner had not had the slightest touch of bad weather. Had there been simply contrary winds to harass her the situation of the crippled chip would have become precarious. But not until just before coming up the harbor did such winds spring up, and then the danger was over and Capt. Ruspini had accomplished his marvelous piece of seamanship.

As the Florida crept along the narrow channel, previous to anchoring off Quarantine, the neighboring shores were packed with throngs of curious people, lining the wharves and perched on every vantage point afforded by sheds and house roots. Around the ship was a regular flotilla of tugs, small yachts, and other craft, keeping up an incessant shrill whistling.

### Wreck of the Florida's Bow.

The appearance presented by the bow or the Florida as she toiled along made Capt. Ruspini's nerve in daring to run her without aid into New York seem almost beyond belief. Big pieces of sail had been strung across the bow. but between them it was possible to look though great, gaping holes as if into the very vitals of the ship.

On one side a big mass of the flooring of the deck had been jammed straight into the air, the jagged edges of the planks sticking out over the water, while a mass of iron railing, twisted like molasses candy, rose into the air on the other side. As for the bow itself or what was left of it, it was nothing but tangled twisted wood and iron, jammed in huge masses against the forward bulkhead. "If that bulkhead should give way,” remarked a sailor on the Florida, “it would be all up with us.”

As the Florida dropped anchor off the shore the little flotilla of tugs closed in on her. One of the first to scramble to her deck and make a dash for the bridge was Count di Massiglia, the Italian Consul General in New York. He seized the hands of Capt. Ruspini and kissed him on both checks. “Your conduct has been noble,” he said, “and I have come here expressly to tell you so.”

Capt. Ruspini leaned against the side of the bridge and smiled. He is only 29 years old. He simply smiled as man after man rushed up to him pouring into his ears praise of his bravery. Among the others who were soon surrounding the young captain on the bridge and congratulating him were Oscar L. Richard, the agent of the Italian Line; Alfred E. Berner, and Albert Egelhoff.

After the effusive congratulations were over everybody inquired at once for Eugene Lynch, the Republic passenger who had been transferred from the latter ship to the Florida suffering from grave internal Injuries. The ship's doctor of the Florida had little encouragement to give concerning the hurt Bostonian.

### Mr. Lynch Ignorant of Wife's Fate.

“You may talk a few words with him,” he said In Italian to the newspaper men who crowded about with inquiries, “but for pity's sake don't tell him that his wife is dead. He knows nothing about it. And, look here,” he added, as he piloted the visitors down through the crew's mess quarters toward the hospital. “If he says anything about a bag full of money which he had on the Republic tell him it's all right and safe, won’t you?”

But when the little group got to the hospital it was not possible to communicate with Mr. Lynch. He lay stretched out on a narrow cot, white and groanIng, and every time he tried to speak his stomach revolted. “Molto male,” said the Italian doctor who had had charge of Mr. Lynch since the Baltic had steamed away. He has a leg and a thigh broken, and is also suffering from injuries to the head, and his heart, too, is In a bad way.”

Nearby lay the dead body of Salvatore D'Amico, a seaman, caught in his bunk In the forecastle and ground to death Eatt the moment of the terrific impact between the Florida and the Republic. As For the two other dead, Piagnolo Lavalie and Catogaro Mortuscello, the doctor simply shrugged his shoulders.

“In there,” he said, pointing toward the heaped, twisted wreckage at the bow. Practically nothing had been done to get the fragments of their bodies out. Capt Ruspini and his crew had their hands full with other problems of rescue and navigation. Sticking out from among the tangled mass at the bow were shreds of cloth and flesh, and there were red blood stains, too.

Ten men in the employ of the John M. Robbins Shipbuilding Company worked with crowbars and axes for four hours last night in extricating the mangled bodies of the Italian sailors. They were placed in pine boxes and taken to the undertaking establishment of Jacob Schafer, 4,014 Third Avenue, South Brooklyn.

The dead are: Balogero Martuscilli, sixteen-year-old sailor from Naples; Pasquale La Vallu, 29 years old, from Naples also, and the fourteen-year-old cabin boy, Salvatore d'Amico.

### Escaped One Horror to Meet Another

According to some of the sailors on the ship, this voyage was D' Amico's first. His home was In the region of the earthquake he had left it in ruins, the only survivor from a large family and he had taken to the sea as much to escape the memories of the earthquake and to avoid the horror danger of a repetition of it as for any other reason.

The boy's body, because smaller than the rest, was alone recognizable; the names of the others were learned only because they were the missing ones among the crew; it was Impossible to tell which was which.

At first it was difficult to make Capt. Ruspini or his officers talk. About them there is nothing of the excited, gesticulatory character which is usually associated with Italians. They walked about on the bridge smiling and calm, giving the necessary orders quite like sea dogs of Anglo-Saxon extraction.

“It was very bad, Oh! a very bad thing Indeed." declared Purser Gino Maraviglia when urged to describe what he had seen. And he cheerfully asked the questioners to partake of cognac and marsala, served by an impassive steward, in the very shadow of the wreckage concealing the two dead men in the forecastle.

But eventually Capt. Ruspini was cornered in his cabin, just off the bridge.

“Really, I can say nothing,” he said, modestly and embarrassed, “until I have made my detailed report to the Consul and the company, and heard what the Captain of the Republic has to say about the collision.” But eventually he began describing the accident while the Florida was slowly limping into her dock in Brooklyn.

### Capt. Ruspini’s Story.

“I was on watch with the first officer," he said, and was going at half speed through the fog, whistling all the time. I heard a blast of the whistle on the right side, and answered with another. In a few seconds there was something like a mountain straight across the path of the Florida. We then crashed squarely into the side of the Republic. Immediately afterward the impetus of the collision itself caused the Florida to back out again from the hole which she had cut in the Republic.

“After the collision I could see nothing whatever. The fog about us was too dense. Then, hearing the blasts of the fire signal on the Republic, I cruised about in every direction, endeavoring to find the ship which we had rammed. While executing this maneuver I saw a little boat approaching us.”

At this point in his narrative the Captain was Interrupted by representatives of the Italian company, who seemed desirous that he should refrain from giving further information regarding the collision. But Purser Maraviglia took up the tale where the Captain had dropped it.

“I was in command of the first boat,” he said, which went from the Florida to the Republic to take off the passengers. The first officer commanded the next boat. The transfer of the Republic's passengers lasted from 7 A. M. until about 10. There was absolutely no panic. Everybody behaved admirably, those on the Republic as well as those of the Florida. In all, the boats from the Florida and Republic, eleven in number, made about twenty-two or twenty-three trips.

“The Republic's passengers stayed on board the Florida an entire day, until it was decided to transfer every body except the crew of the Florida to the Baltic. The transfer to the Baltic was effected between midnight Sunday and 5 A. M. Monday."

### The Narrative Interrupted.

At this point somebody from the company interfered likewise with Purser Maraviglia's narrative. Coming out of the cabin seeing him in the act of spelling out his name for a reporter this Individual cried excitedly, “Don't sign anything!”

From other accounts of those on the Florida it appeared to be the impression that the whistle of the Republic did not blow as frequently as that of the Italian ship.

The extreme danger attendant on the trip of the Florida from the scene of the accident to New York was made greater by a heavy snowfall, which lasted a good part of the way, retarding the already snail-like speed of the ship. But as she drew near to New Cork the weather cleared, and the crippled Italian liner actually went ahead for a part of the way at the rate of ten knots an hour, game to the very finish of her eventful trip. Capt. Raspini had made only one other voyage as her captain.

As the bow of the Florida, smashed up as if it had been of the consistency of a matchbox, was poked into its pier at 5 P. M. yesterday, those on board saw a crowd drawn up around the gangplank, inpatient tor a chance to board the ship. Foremost among these were a party of men, with tear-stained eyes, friends of Eugene Lynch, who but a few days before had bid him godspeed on the occasion of his departure on the Republic. As soon as the gangplank was lowered they hastened to the deck and were immediately token to the sickroom, where Mr. Lynch lay.

In the party were the Rev. James Lee of the Church of the Immaculate Conception at Revere, Mass.; the Hon. John H. Casey and the Hon. William Turtle, Mr. Lynch's lawyers; James McGuinness, husband of the injured man's niece; Finnegan, his brother-in-law, and James Watson, confidential clerk in Mr. Lynch's Boston liquor business. The whole party had come from Boston to take charge of their friend.

### Little Hope for Mr. Leach.

When they arrived on board little hope was held out to them off his recovery. Silent and grief stricken, they stood about their suffering friend, stretched out on a narrow cot, waiting transportation to a hospital. The first ambulance to reach the pier came from the Norwegian Hospital, but Mr. Casey indignantly refused to allow his friend to be put into it, claiming that it was so old as to be unsuitable for taking so severely injured a patient away from the wharf. The Boston party then sought a telephone, summoned an ambulance from the Long Island College Hospital, and reserved for Mr. Lynch the best private room at that hospital. When the ambulance came racing along the wharf the injured man was brought groaning down the gangplank. “God bless all," he murmured to those who were carrying him. From start to finish he had shown great fortitude.

Be sure that all those on Florida get something from me as a remembrance,” was his parting instruction to one of his friends before he was carried on his stretcher down the gangplank.

The removal of Mr. Lynch from the Republic to the Florida, it was said on the latter vessel, was attended with such difficulty that the injured man himself desired that he be allowed to stay where he was when the transfer of all except the crew of the Florida to the Baltic was begun. “If I am to die, let me die here.” he said. As his condition was considered very serious, Father Morris of Trenton, one of the passengers taken from the Republic, administered the last sacrament to Mr. Lynch.

Immediately after the Florida had tied tip to her pier, electric lights were strung on wires across her smashed bow, and the gruesome work of extricating the bodies of the two seamen jammed to death in the wreckage there was begun. Capt. Ruspini and the other officers of the ship remained closeted with the representatives of the line, and refused all further information to the reporters, who were eventually ushered to the pier.

The report that the cause of the collision was that the man at the Florida’s wheel fell asleep while on duty, for which negligence he received a blow In face from Capt. Raspini, was indignantly denied soon after the docking of the Florida by the Italian Royal Commissioner, who had charge of the immigrants on the Florida on her way across the ocean.

The Florida came from Nantucket most of the way at a rate above four or five knots an hour, simply creeping along.

## DENY HELMSMAN NODDED.

### Rumors of a Sleepy Quartermaster Fight on Florida Find No Sponsor.

A story which was denied as often as it was repeated, and was quite impossible of authoritative verification, was told on board the Baltic yesterday regarding quartermaster the Florida, said to have been at the wheel at the time of collision.

The story, as told. was that early on Saturday morning, while the Florida was feeling her way through the fog off Nantucket, with Capt. Voltolin on the bridge, the Republic, then evidently quite close to the Florida, sounded two sharp whistles in answer to a long blast from a horn. This is the well-understood signal for the approaching vessel to turn to port. The acceptance of the signal is a single blast of the whistle. The officers of the Republic say that the Florida’s whistle returned the expected answer.
