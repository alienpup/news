### No Lack of Life-Saving Devices, Says Uhler.

WASHINGTON. Jan. 27. — Supervising Inspector-General George Uhler, of the United States Steamboat Inspection SerVice, said to-day:

“We have hot been Informed of any lack of adequate life-saving apparatus on any of he big liners. With special reference to the Republic and Florida we do know that at the time they were last inspected all the regulations had been observed. In the case of the public, as she is a British vessel. our inspection would be in the nature of the verification of the facts laid forth in her certificate of inspection from the British Admiralty's Bureau of Inspection. Great Britain Is one of the nations with which the United States maintains reciprocal relations in these matters.”

## REPUBLIC SAVED FROM BLOWING UP BY NEW HERO

Captain Sealby, Second Officer Williams and Wireless Operator Binns were not the only heroes on the sinking Republic. To their names must be added that of Fourth Engineer J. G. Legg.

It was learned today that Legg, a Glasgow boy of twenty-four, was chiefly responsible for the saving of the Republic from a tremendous explosion. Had he been derelict in his duty not six or seven, but perhaps six or seven hundred might have lost their lives in the crash of the White Star liner with the Italian ship Florida.

Late at night, when passengers and principal officers were asleep, young Legg was on duty in the engine room. Under his command, shoveling coal into the stokeholes were sixteen of the “black squad," stokers and trimmers.

### Danger of Explosion.

When the crash came, W. L. Scott, first assistant engineer, was asleep in his bunk. He shouted:

"Oh. Leggie!”

A moment later he ran to the door overlooking the stokehole, attired grotesquely in blue pajamas and a tennis blazer.

"Make her right, Leggie! he yelled.

Young Legg, glancing at the indicators, saw that the Republic was carrying 215 pounds of steam. He realized that If the cold sea water poured in against the plates of the boiler a terrible explosion was Inevitable.

“Turn on the Injectors!“ ordered the young Scotchman.

By this time the water had come pouring into the Republic's stokehole until it surged around the waist lines of her boiler crew. But not a single man deserted.

Four or five of the “black squad" sprang for the injector cocks, and an Instant later a stream of cold water reduced the boiler pressure by many pounds A second order come from the cool Mr. Legg.

"Close the dampers!” he said.

### Others Deserving Credit.

This was done, and by the time the water swirled around the necks of the "black squad" the sixteen men who had stuck to their posts while the deck men and officers above were doing the spectacular things, the steam pressure had been reduced to a point where no incoming water, no matter how chilled, could have caused the boilers to burst.

Young Legg was not the only one deserving of credit, although he did most of the actual work. The crash that sounded when the Florida’s bow burst through the side plates the of the Republic  awakened from their bunks Chief Engineer James McGowan, Second Engineer Willam Scott, Third  enginner John Tully and the fourth, fifth  and sixth assistants. Smethurst, Jenkins and Richardson. Every man of Them ran down into the steam-clouded boiler room.

In less than live minutes they had done everything possible.

## BINNS ALLED HELP FOR THE REPUBLIC WITH BROKEN KEY

## Wireless Operator Held Broken Lever With One Hand While He Flashed the "C. Q. D." Message Out With the Other.

By far the most graphic description of the wreck of the White Star liner Republic was told today in an article from the pen of "Jack" Binns, the wireless operator, to whom every man, woman and child on the Republic probably owes life.

Binns Is a modest hero. He doesn't think he has done more than any other man who is paid for his services. His nerves are not in working order after his long siege in his small cabin on the Republic, when water was gurgling in the holds and the big sip was careening in the fog clouds off Nantucket. The act that he almost starved seems of little consequence to “Jack” Binns.

Binns is just an ordinary English lad with a faculty for being where there Is trouble. His home is in Petersburg suburb of London. He was On the Blucher close to Martinique when the city was wiped out by the volcano eruption, and recently, when the volcano eruption occurred in Southern Italy, he was on the Republic near Sicily.

The only pay he got from the White Star Line Company was one shilling a trip, which merely made him a member of the ship's company. His only living salary came from the Marconi company.

Haven't got cent, remarked the wireless operator when he landed in New York. Haven't a cigarette either, he added.

Some man who was hovering near Binns gave him 10 cents. Another admirer supplied the cigarette. The admiration the young operator was getting drove him into embarrassment, and then into fight, and he went into seclusion to write the full story of the collision and the sinking of the Republic as he saw it. Here is his story:

### "Jack” Binn’s Story.

I had just turned in for a few hours after the previous day's work when the shock of the impact shook me out of my bunk. A crunching, ripping noise followed as the Florida' bows crumpled up on our side. The panels and side of our cabin fell in, one panel being smashed to splinters, but fortunately the wireless apparatus was unhurt and remained standing.

I had a fear, however, that the aerial wires between the masts might been shaken down, so I hastily tested them, and most fortunately they still intact.

“My first impression was that we had ran ashore, which was strengthened when I  peered through the interstices of the wrecked woodwork of my cabin and saw a dark object outside over which the sea was washing. This I took to be rock, but later found was Boat No. 15, which always swung out from the ship and which bad been torn from its davits.

### Sounded the “C. Q. D."

Five minutes after the collision the lights all through the ship went out and we were in total darkness. I tried to make my way to the bridge in order to report to the captain that my gear was all right, but, unable to make my way through the wreckage. I returned to my wrecked cabin again. The dynamos being stopped greatly handicapped the working distance of our station, but the accumulators were in good condition, and so I immediately sounded the “C. Q. D.” signal, which announced to surrounding ships the peril of our position.

Just then the captain's steward came to me from the bridge and piloted me through the debris. On the boat deck all the passengers were assembled, and the crew had already got the boats swung out, for, despite the darkness, everything was done in an orderly and smart manner.

### Reassured the Passengers.

“I reported to Capt. Sealby that everything was all right with my wireless instruments, and he hastened to reassure the passengers, brave but anxious, with this most comforting bit of news.

“This having been done. I returned Immediately to my cabin and had the satisfaction of gaining the attention of our station at Siasconsett on Nantucket Island. This is the message flashed to A. H. Ginman, the operator there:

“’The Republic. We are shipwrecked. Stand by for captain's message.’

“This was the answer that was immediately flashed back to us:

“AII right, old man. Where are you?'

"At this stage our chief officer came, and anxiously inquired if I had yet got in communication with anybody, and was greatly relieved to learn that Siasconsett had answered me. He at once hastened to the captain to convey this intelligence. Capt. Sealby then sent me this message for transmission:

### Capt. Sealby's Message.

“’Republic rammed by unknown steamer. Twenty-six miles southwest of Nantucket Lightship. Badly in need of immediate assistance, but no danger to life. SEALBY.'

“Five minutes later Siasconsett informed me that he had sent for the revenue cutter Acushnet, then lying at Wood's Hole, and that it was to proceed to assist us. Word had also been sent to the steamships Baltic, La Lorraine and City of Everett.

“I was now working under extreme difficulties, as it was very dark. I had unfortunately broken the lever of my sending key just after the lights went out, but eventually managed all right by holding the broken lever with one hand and sending with the other.

### The Dead Discovered.

"Then came the first respite I had had since the force of the crash had hurled me from my bunk. It was now getting light, and with the first streaks of dawn was enabled to look about me and comprehend he damage what had been wrought, together with the extreme peril of our position. This was more vividly brought home to me when, glancing at the floor just outside of my wrecked cabin, I saw the mangled bodies of two passengers. The light was not strong enough for me to make out who they were or whether they were the bodies of men or women, but both were mangled beyond recognition, and for the first time I knew that human lives had been sacrificed in the crash of the fogbound ships.

“Capt. Sealby was on the bridge all this time, but soon after I discovered the bodies lying near me Dr. Marsh came along, and after examining the bodies, announced that both bad been killed outright. Blankets were stretched over the two still forms, and a little later they were laid in coffins. It was not until a roll call had been made that the identity of the dead was established.

### Horror of the Scene.

“Sick with the horror the scene it had been enacted before my very eyes, I was indeed grateful for the brief respite that followed. I drew on my boots, and a waistcoat, and was lucky enough to find an apple and some water at hand, but it was bitterly cold in the cabin, for a stiff breeze was blowing through the splintered woodwork, and then too, the blinding fog filtered all about me, chilling me to the marrow.  I was soon busy again, once more in communication with the Siasconset station, doing my utmost to locate the Baltic. I could hear the Baltic's wireless signals as they were flashed to shore, but my disabled spark was too weak to reach the Baltic's operator.

Just as the Florida returned to us the Baltic began to pick up my signals, and from then on I was kept busy notifying that ship of our position, and from that time forward steady Interchange of messages between Tattersall and Balfour, the Baltic’s operators, and myself.

### Transferred Without Mishap.

“The passengers were transferred to the Florida, and not a single mishap occurred to mar this perilous work. The fog lifted for few minutes shortly before noon on Saturday, and I happened to look out at that moment and saw the Florida with her bows gone, almost to the bridge, the majority of remaining plates remaining In ribbons and twisted beyond recognition.

"About 2 o’clock I realized for the first time that I was hungry, and Douglas, my steward, who had been running to and from the bridge all morning with messages for and from the captain, was able to get bite of food and a cup of coffee for me, which I devoured while sending and receiving messages.

### The Lorraine Gets in Touch.

"Early in the afternoon the Lorraine was able to read us, and we began to give her steering directions, but it was very difficult for her navigator to find us on account of the blanket of fog that enveloped the sea. The hours of the afternoon dragged slowly, and they were filled with anxiety for the captain and all on board. Darkness set in early, superinduced, of course, by the thick weather. The most anxious hour of the day was at about 6 o'clock in the evening, when Capt. Sealby heard, only faintly, the explosion of a bomb in the far distance. He at once communicated with me, and made inquiries, learning that the Baltic had been exploding bombs in an effort to apprise us of her whereabouts. We, too, had been exploding bombs, but exhausted our supply, and from now on had nothing but our almost exhausted and fast-weakening wireless apparatus to which we could pin our hopes of rescue.

“The Baltic then informed me that she had but a solitary bomb left, and arranged with us that this would be exploded at a certain moment. This was done, and as we heard the faint rumble there was no further doubt in our minds that the Baltic would soon find us as we tossed about, marooned, as it were, in the fog, and not knowing how long we could remain afloat.

### How Directions Were Given.

"Capt. Sealby took the direction from which the sound came, and so I was then able to give the Baltic Capt. Sealby's orders as to what course the sister ship was to steer to reach us.

"These steering directions Capt. Sealby changed at times in accordance with the change of sound direction, and a little later we heard the Baltic's fog horn blowing faintly, and this increased in volume as she lessened the distance between us. Occasionally we fired rockets, but they could not be seen through the fog, although a little later the Baltic's siren was heard so plainly that we knew the ship was close by. Realizing this, Capt. Sealby issued orders that the Baltic be told to proceed as carefully as possible, as she was now too close on our port side to be safe.

### The Baltic at Hand at Last.

"I had just communicated this message when I heard a cheer, and I at once realized that these sounds of rejoicing could not come from our men, as only Capt. Sealby, the officers, myself and the crew were aboard our ship, and they were all busily engaged in standing by the boats, looking aft through my splintered cabin I made out the Baltic quite near the stern of our ship, the fog having again lifted somewhat. She was a blaze of light, and as sat there in my little cabin the thought occurred to me that the most beautiful sight in the world is a ship at sea, especially when that ship is needed to supply a link between life and death. Time and again it occurred to me as I worked away in feverish haste, a mere machine voicing the words of our gallant captain who so heroically watched over tho the safety of those who had entrusted their lives to him, that the end was near: that it was only a question of how long the ship could withstand the wound that pierced her very vitals, and I had practically resigned myself to the fate every seafaring man has before him at some time in his career. I never expected to see New York again, and as I sit here writing this narrative it all comes back to me like a terrible nightmare.

### Settling Fast.

“we were now settling apparent fast, and Capt. Sealby sent this message to me for the Baltic:

Come to our leeward and take up our boats. Have Lorraine and Lucania convoy the Florida.

“‘This message concluded with words:  Wireless now closed.’

“The Captain then sent word to me to come forward from my cabin as soon as I had sent the message off. Reporting to the Captain, I was told to take the boats with the officers and the crew, who were about to be transferred to the Baltic. By that time the weather had cleared to a considerable extent, but a heavy swell was running. After a stiff pull we reached the Baltic, whose people gave the heartiest kind of a cheer as we came along side. Our sailors were about to respond to the welcome when Mr. Williams the second officer, who was at the tiller, said my hearties, steady. Keep cool let them see come up in good style.” And, without a word, we ran in alongside the gangway.

As soon as all the sailors and officers were abound, with the exception of Capt. Sealby, Chief Officer Crossland, the boatswain, and a boat's crew, who were standing by the ship, Capt. Sealby megaphoned to Capt. Ranson, of the baltic, asking him to the assistance the Florida, and leave me, as I am all night.

### Perilous Transfer Successful.

When the Baltic came alongside of the Florida the Baltic's and Republic's officers and sailors, using the Republic's boats, began to transfer the passengers from the disabled Florida to the Baltic. This task was extremely difficult and perilous, as there was heavy swell running, with the sea momentarily Increasing, causing the bouts to bump violently against the gangway. The greatest difficulty had was inducing the women passengers to leap at the right moment.

“Upward of 2,00 people were transferred during the night, and the greatest credit Is due to our officers and seamen for the magnificent and cool manner In which they conducted this most arduous undertaking, as it was only their strenuous and unceasing efforts that prevented loss of life. Cowards? Not a bit of it! Never, and I mean it absolutely, was there a braver lot of men whose courage was put to the most crucial test. They came through the trying ordeal with colors flying, and reflected wonderful credit upon that most splendid and bravest of masters, Capt. Sealby.

“Our officers and crew had no sleep Saturday night. I was more fortunate, having snatched a few hours rest in one of the cabins. The following morning the Florida (she had a very perceptible list to port Saturday night) had righted herself somewhat and her Captain apparently had decided to go to New York without assistance.

### Asked for Volunteers.

“The Baltic steamed back to the Republic, and Capt. Sealby shouted across asking for volunteers to go and stand by the Republic. The officers, many sailors, a cook, and one or two stewards, including Chief Steward Stanyar and the second class chief steward, the saloon steward, and myself, all went over, which, including the Captain, who had remained aboard all night, made thirty-eight of us all told.

“Arriving on board, I tested my wireless apparatus, found it to be all right, and so reported the same to the Captain who at once made wireless inquiries for the tugs that had been sent our assistance.

By this time the Furnessia had arrived and had been standing by, then the Florida came alongside of the Republic, remaining there as safeguard for those of us left on our ship, and the Baltic took up her journey to New York with her tremendous burden of human freight. As she steamed by our stern, where our captain and officers had assembled. every living soul aboard the Baltic gave us a hearts cheer.

"After seeing the Baltic vanish from view, I bethought me of my wrecked cabin, and later. nailing up some blankets around the rent sides, I soon made it more habitable, and was able to keep sheltered from the chill air. Once more I was ready for business.

The volunteer cook had prepared us a meal, and this we had just partaken of when the revenue cutter Gresham arrived. She took one of our lines on board, and, steaming ahead, commenced to tow us, with the Furnessia attached by two lines to our stern, to steer us.

### Ordered to Abandon Ship.

"At about 4 o'clock Sunday afternoon we had shipped so much water that Capt. Sealby decided to order the crew to the boats and transfer them to the Gresham. I had put a box of cigarettes at my side, so that in case we left in a hurry I could snatch them up, but so unexpectedly did the order come that I forgot to take them, and being somewhat addicted to the tobacco habit, and with nothing to smoke, my pangs became more and more acute as night wore on.

One of the officers then ordered me to the boat. Capt. Sealby and Second Officer Williams remaining on the fast settling Republic.

“This time we were taken aboard the Gresham. Reaching across the stern of the Gresham were two steel hawsers, which were attached to the Republic bows. Capt. Perry then ordered that a nine-inch rope hawser be attached to that end of the steel hawser, and then paid out until the rope was wrapped around the bit of the Gresham. An axe was laid alongside of the rope hawser, so that in case the Republic settled further or sunk the rope could be cut., and thus free the Gresham. A bout was lying alongside the Gresham, ready to rescue Capt. Sealby and Williams in case it was necessary.

At about 5 o’clock the derelict  destroyer under command of Capt. Reynolds, came along, and put aboard the Gresham and helped the latter tow the Republic. Two hours later we missed the lights of the of the Furnessia. At 5 o'clock a signal was sent to the Republic and the Gresham's hawser was severed. The crew was in the lifeboat, and the searchlight was playing upon the spot almost before the rest of us were standing around could realize it. We caught one fleeting glimpse of the poor Republic’s bows, which were shown up by the searchlight. After that we saw no more of her.

### Cheers for Sealby and Williams.

“A heavy sea was running and every man standing on the Gresham’s quarterdeck was straining his eyes to follow the movements of the little boat that was casting about in search of Capt. Sealby and and Second Officer Williams. On account of the high sea running we could not make anything out, and it was an anxious time we spent until we finally hailed her and learned that Capt.
