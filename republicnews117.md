## (Copyrighted, 1909, by the Press Publishing Company.) BY JOHN ROBINSON BINNS.

By the time I was able to walk I had neither father nor mother to speak to. Father, a factory engineer, passed away two days after my birth—almost as soon as he saw me—and mother, a hardy Yorkshire lass, only living a year after this event, you may call it. My full name is Jack Robinson Bins, after my father, and I was born twenty-five years ago—July 4, 1884, so you see I am somewhat of an American by birth.

I was the only child, and Grandmother Binns, my father's mother, took me from the lonely little cabin in which I was born, outside Briggs, Lincolnshire, to her home. She was good to me; taught me to spell and write, told me of my folks and my home, and the hills about Lincoln- shire where my father hunted and roved. He was an adventuresome Briton, and I guess being forced to work broke his heart early.

At fourteen I was a big lad and could boot a ball, shoot a gun or use my dukes with any my inches and lots bigger. had a fair education, and, being an observant fellow, I managed to get a good idea of life, principally in roaming about Lincolnshire with my grandmother, who moved about every year. Then I decided to shift or myself. didn't know what to do. I straggled into railroad office one day and saw a dozen young men drawing lines.

### Starts Work for a Railroad.

That decided me. I wanted to be a draughtsman. I got a place with the Great Eastern Railroad. There was no opening at once, and each day I hung about the railroad telegraph office until the operator took pity on me and taught me the code. In two weeks I could *send but not receive." Learning telegraphy was my first 'accident." Then came the second. One day I was crawling under some cars when an engine bumped the "string" and I fell. Two cars ran over my right foot and left leg. That was Dec. 8, 1898.

In the six months I was in the hospital they gave me up four times. Finally, my temperature got to 107—the highest on record at that time, the surgeons said, and they left me to die that day. Toward night saw three long-whiskered men standing over me. One said: "Let's try it on him—it's our only chance. No one will know!”

I didn't know what it was about. I figured it was all off, anyhow, and didn't mind it much. Then I saw them bringing in a long needle, half an inch thick. They punctured my back. I found out after that Was a newly discovered serum, called "anti-streptococcus,” I was the first human patient they ever experimented on with it. Well, it was a hit with me. I began to get better right along, and my leg muscles and ankles are as strong as any man my size.

### Took Out Nine Pieces of Bone.

They took out nine pieces of bone, some of them more than an inch long. One was twisted like a drill. I put them all in alcohol and had them with me when the Republic went down. So, you see, I'm with the old ship yet-in part, anyhow.

While getting better I kept practicing at a little key, and when able to get about went to work again- on crutches. Four years more were spent with the Great Eastern—they had promised me a job for life. I was a good operator when I quit, in 1902, to take a job with the British Post-Office in Colchester Essex.

It was here had my third accident. Over there you sleep right under the roof. One night the house took fire. I had been awake twenty-six hours and was sound asleep. No bells or shouts reached me. Finally felt my face warm. I tumbled out bed to see the sky above me and flames eating away the last shingle on the roof. My bed was burning and ashes were piled on my clothes, I rolled down to the edge and tumbled to the ground. My hair was singed. Two minutes after the floor crashed in. Then hey called me "Lucky Jack."

I was at Newmarket race course a year and played the ponies with all my earnings. I didn't have enough to en joy the sport, but sometimes got some good tips and cashed. When the sea-son closed, in 1904, I resigned to go to sea with the Marconi company. They gave me a mechanical instruction in Liverpool and I made the course in three weeks.

### First Trip as C. Q. D. Man.

My first assignment was the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. That trip they started out from Hamburg with Count Witte. They didn't figure me experlenced enough and put me off at Southampton. I made up my mind it wouldn't happen again, and finally I got the Grosser Kurfuerst, in December, 1905. Until 1907 I was the only operator aboard the Bluecher, making ports from Spitzbergen, 400 miles from the North Pole, to harbors in South and Central America. There weren't many wireless stations then, and about the only exercise I got was talking to passing steamers.

We touched at Kingston a few days after the earthquake there, and I distinctly felt a shock just before reaching the harbor. Things were pretty well cleaned up when we reached land. There was no wireless there then.

On my trip in February 1907, I met Joe Cannon, Vice-President-Elect Sherman and a bunch of Congressmen on their national junket trip to Panama. One day a shark swallowed a hook, line and chain from a boat load of sailors trying to catch him and dropped to the bottom after upsetting the boat. All the lawmakers laughed, and begin sending wireless to their homes telling of the incident. I had all their signatures In my collection of souvenirs from every port and boat I met, but all went down with the Republic.

The only time I ever met a C. Q. D. accident was off St. Augustine on the way back. She was a new bark, stripped of everything, and 200 miles from coast. She had a crew of twelve and a captain. They were almost frozen. No food for days and ready to drop into the sea. We got 'em aboard and then burned the bark and sank her. She needed C. Q. D. if ever a vessel did.

### Got the "J. O." Message.

On the way up the famous “J. O.” message broke loose. It was addressed to Mr. Sherman and came from land. It was at the time of the Roosevelt-Harriman controversy. My oath prevents me from repeating Its contents, but the papers published it as forbidding the members of the committee to talk to newspaper men. It was signed “J. O.” It was claimed that the leak came from the wireless room. We were fully vindicated afterward.

Back to Hamburg again and I was shifted to my first love the Kaiser Wilhelm der Grosse. I was an expert then. I only made one trip with the German and was sent to the President Lincoln to fit her with wireless and introduce it. After one trip I got the Kaiserin Auguste Victoria. When we got back President-elect Taft was completing his trip about the world. He was returning on the President Grant and I got the job.

He enjoyed the trip and we had many chats. He's an excellent man and will make a splendid President. Then came the Berlin Conference, which forced only German speaking operators aboard the German boats. After a time at Crook's Haven, in Ireland, a ship station, I joined the Republic in Liverpool. It was the 14th of last November. We sailed between Liverpool, Boston and New York.

My next assignment? Well, I go where I'm sent, but if Capt. Sealby gets a ship I want to go with him and stick with him, too. His example and nobility of command in the face of such peril won for the good brave master the confidence which even wireless could not give the passengers. His splendid example must be ranked with the success of the wireless when history writes the log of the Republic.

WASHINGTON, Jan. 28.- Following the achievements of wireless telegraphy the recent collision between the steamers Republic and Florida, the Navy Department. to-day opened bids for locating a wireless tower in Washington for communicating with ships at sea, to the distance of 3,000 miles.

For a long time the department has felt the desirability of the development of wireless telegraphy as a means of communicating for long distances between central stations at various points in the United States with the commands at sea. An effort was at first made to secure the Washington Monument, because of its great height, for this purpose, but this met with disapproval by the President, and bids for constructing a lower were invited several months ago.

The specifications require that the tower or station shall be capable of transmitting messages at all times and at all seasons In a radius of 3,000 miles in any navigational direction from Washington. The messages are not co be interrupted by atmospherie disturbances or interference by neighboring stations.

At the same time the department. asked for bids for two sets of apparatus to be installed on naval vessels, to be capable of transmitting and receiving messages at all times, seasons latitudes, to and from a distance of 1,000 miles, and to to receive messages from the Washington station at a distance of 3,000 miles at all times.

The bids submitted today indicated a lively competition, so less than seven firms submitting proposals. The most satisfactory of those, according to the officials, was that of the National Electric Signaling Company of Pittsburg, which offered to furnish the apparatus and tower for $182,600.

Features of some DL the other bids, which Included ideas not called for in the specifications, favorably Impressed the officials, and they may receive consideration before the award ls made.

Another manifestation of the Interest of Congress in the proposed compulsory equipment of ocean going steamers with wireless telegraph apparatus was evidenced today, when Representative Peters of Massachusetts introduced bill more general in its application than the first bill on the subject, introduced  by Burke of Pennsylvania. Mr. Peters proposes to require wireless telegraph equipment on all ocean-going vessels, in both the foreign and domestic service, plying between ports more than 100 miles distant. The Burke bill applies to vessels in the foreign service. A maximum penalty of $1,000 is provided in the Peters bill.

### LIBELS THE FLORIDA.

### White Star Line Also Presents to the Court Its Version of the Collision.

The responsibility for the sinking of the White Star Miner Republic, the damaging of the Lloyd Italian steamer Florida, the question as to the speed at which both vessels were going when they came together and the right to damages are all to be threshed out In the United Stater District Court. The Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, as owners of the Republic, libeled the Florida yesterday, and she was seized by United States Marshal Henkel, under a writ of attachment. The libellant asks $2,000,000 damages, of which sum $1,300,000 be asked for the vessel, freight, supplies, and passage money and the remainder for the personal effects of officers, crew, and passengers.

The owners of the Florida have asked the court to fix the limit of lability at $220,000, the value of the vessel, the freight, and passage money. The papers say that the collision was solely caused by the faults and neglect on the part of the part of the Republic." There will be no cross libel, as the Republic is sunk, and there is no vessel for the Italian line to libel, but the latter repeats its declaration of intention to fight the case to the end.

The libellant describes the Republic as being tight, stanch, and seaworthy. At the time of the collision she is said to have been heading south 84 degrees east true, and going under reduced speed. What happened just before the vessels struck is told in detail, as follows:

### Official Republic Version.

About 5:45 A M. a signal or one whistle was heard and reported on the Republic's port bow. Immediately the orders” stop” and “full speed astern” were given to the engine room, and the helm was ported. These orders were at once obeyed, and at the same time a signal of three whistles was given. Shortly afterward there was made out broad off the Republic's part side a number of bright lights, apparently from a large vessel, (which proved to be the Florida,) both of whose sidelights soon came into view The Florida was bearing down on the Republic at high speed, threatening to strike the Republic a right angle blow amidships. In the effort to escape the blow the master put the engines of the Republic ahead, but the Florida came on at a high rate of speed, apparently swinging under a starboard helm, and crashed head on into the port side of the Republic, penetrating into the engine room. The collision occurred about 5:50 A. M.

The stem of the Florida struck the Republic's port side nearly a square blow and made a narrow, vertical cut, extending well below the water line, straining and starting the bulkheads. Under her momentum, the Florida's bow, where It struck the side plating and frames, was crumpled back some thirty feet. The top of the Florida's bow passed above the Republic's side plating, so that it reached and wrecked the cabins along the saloon and promenade decks, causing the death of two passengers and injuring two others. The Republic's engine room was quickly flooded, and although the bulkhead doors were closed, the soundings showed that the ship was settling aft.

### Florida Accused of Speeding.

The story of the transfer of the passengers and the sinking of the boat is then set forth. In contending that the accident was due to the fault of the Florida it is charged that she did not keep her proper course: that she did not have a proper lookout, and that her officers not only did not give proper whistles, but that they did not pay heed to the whistles and lights of the Republic. It is also declared that the Florida was going at immoderate speed, and that she did not stop her engines when the first whistles of the Republic were heard by those on her bridge.

The most serious charge is that there was a lack of presence of mind on the Italian liner, and that In the critical moment, when the Republic appeared out of the fog, the helm of the Florida was thrown suddenly to starboard instead of to port, thus throwing her directly in the path of the Republic, thwarting all the efforts of Capt. Sealby to clear the oncoming Florida.

### To Recognize Bing's Heroism.

PARIS. Jan. 28. — The Maritime Committee of the Chamber of Deputies has decided to ask the Government to recognize in a special manner the heroism of John R. Binns, the Marconi operator aboard the Republic.
