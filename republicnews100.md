tested because of Mr. Lynch’s condition but the minister demanded that the man be taken to the Long Island City hospital. After a two-hour wait an ambulance from that hospital appeared and he was taken there.

While aboard the Republic the last rites of the Church had been administered to Mr Lynch by the Rev. Dr.. Norris, chaplain of the Trenton Diocese. Before leaving the Florida Mr. Lynch asked that the nurse and doctor be reimbursed for their trouble and for their kindness to him.

## Chief Officer of "Rudder" Ship Tells How Republic Sank

The Anchor liner Furnessla, Captain James Lumsdane, five days overdue from Glasgow which turned to and aided in the effort to save the sinking Republic, docked shortly after 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon. The Furnessia for many hours rode astern of the doomed vessel, carrying two of the Republic's, 12-Inch hawsers and acting as a rudder, while the revenue cutter Gresham, and later the Gresham and the derelict destroyer Seneca, attempted to tow her Into shallow water, where she might be beached.

What happened is best told in the words of Chief Officer William Mitchell, of the Furnessia.

### Barely Caught the Message.

“The wireless first began to pick up the Baltic on Saturday night," said Mr. Mitchell “It was with great difficulty at first that Colven caught the message that the Republic had been in collision. Captain Lumsdane at once started in her direction. It was a mighty ticklish task, and we had to proceed slowly. Hardly one of the officers or crew of the Furnessia had a wink of Sleep Saturday night. We knew the New York and Campania were cruising in the neighborhood.

It was about Sunday morning when we caught sight of the Baltic and were told that all of the Republic's passengers had been transferred to her. It was about 10:30 o'clock when we first came up with the Republic, then well down in the water. I started for her with a boat's crew. Just then the Gresham came, and it was decided that the cutter should attempt to tow the Republic in, while the Furnessia acted as rudder. My boat brought back lines from the Republic's stern to the Furnessia. The Gresham made fast her towing gear, but could hardly stir the big liner. I don't think we were making above a knot until the Seneca came up and aided us. Even then the speed was but little better.

### Furnessia’s - Lines Parted.

"About 6:30 o'clock our lines parted, and in the darkness and fog was impossible to do anything. At nightfall we had word by the wireless that the Gresham had taken everybody off the Republic except her captain and chief officer. A bout 8 o'clock a breeze sprang up, and half an hour later we missed the Republic. The wireless brought us word that she had gone down about 8:30. At 9 o’clock the Gresham wired us that by the aid of searchlights the captain and the chief officer of the Republic had been saved. We stayed about for a time, and then when we were sure that there was no further need of our waiting longer, we came on slowly toward New York.”

The Furnessia carries no first cabin passengers. She had 95 second cabin passengers, and 178 in the steerage. One day the Furnessia logged only seventy-six miles. During the gale a woman passenger was knocked senseless when knocked against her cabin door by the pitching of the boat. A male passenger was also hurt, the passengers say.

## Wireless Hero of Baltic Tells How Republic was Found

The hero of the Baltic is J. Tattersall, the plucky wireless operator, who found the Republic in the thickest sort of a Nantucket fog. For twenty-four hours he was almost constantly at his receiver, for until the Republic was definitely located he could not leave the instrument even to his capable assistant, G. W. Balfour.

Tattersall is running a close race in wireless heroism with Binns, the Republics operator, who stuck by the ship until there was not another spark in his batteries and who then returned as a volunteer to stay until the end. You would have trouble in making Tattersall think so, however, and he had to be hunted for all over the ship when an American reporter wanted to ask about it yesterday afternoon.

He is a typical Englishman, is Tattersall, even to red whiskers. He is young und limber and shows the strain of little sleep much less than many of the passengers.

### Shore Batteries Interfered.

“It would not the have been so bad had Shore batteries kept off." said the young operator, when he was finally persuaded to talk about his work. "You see, the minute the Republic's engines stopped her wireless machine lost its direct current. Binns had to use his accumulators, which are not good for more than seventy miles at best.

"Now, on shore, at Siasconset and Woods Hole, were powerful stations, with a flash radius of 200 miles. You can imagine what happened to poor Binns's best but feeble efforts when these stations got into range. They Insisted on calling me, and for a time the best I could do was to hammer back: “We're coming, Republic; we're on our wary.” The stations on shore and on the Lucania and La Lorraine were all pounding away, and I could tell by the manner in which poor Binns's instrument was working that he was getting weaker and weaker. It was as though you were close to a friend who was dying, and you were straining every nerve to catch his last word, and then every instant some one with a stentorian voice would put his head in the room and shout for information about his condition, drowning your dying friend's voice.

### Was Dozing at Desk.

"When I got the first C. Q. D. I was dozing at my desk. There had been nothing startling during the night, and I was expecting nothing. At first I did not know what it all meant. Then it flashed on me that I was getting a cry for help, and a moment later came the details, that the Republic had been sadly rammed and was in such and such latitude and longitude.

I did not even wait to call for a steward. I bolted out of the wireless cabin and ran up the deck to the bridge. I handed it to Captain Ranson myself.

“‘We will go to them,' he said quietly, hurrying into his chart room.

"I went back to my instruments and started in to tell the Republic we were coming. It was not until we were within forty miles of them that I began to get into direct communication. At first the flashes were so faint that could hardly spell them out. Many messages I lost altogether. All the while Woods Hole or some other infernal operator cut in on me. I know they meant well, but it increased the difficulty of finding the Republic.

### Exhausted by Vigil.

“You want details of the search? Well. you'll have to get them somewhere else. I can't give them to you. It's all a jumble with me. I guess I'm nearly all in. What do you think happened, though, Saturday night while we were transferring the passengers from the Florida? Who walked into my cabin but Binns.

“Hello, Tattersall says he, just as cheerful as it he'd come from a garden party. We've been having a lively time of it, haven't we? Thought I’d drop in and see how you were, old chap.”

"Then he went back to the sinking ship and stayed by her until the Captain ordered the crew off. He couldn't send any more wirelesses, but he thought he might be useful somewhere.”

## Congress Halts Its Work to Honor Brave Jack Binns

Washington. Jan. 25 - “Jack” Binns, the Marconi operator on the steamship Republic, is to go down into history side by side with "Jim" Bludso.

The House of Representatives halted its proceedings today to eulogize him as few private American citizens have ever been honored. Henry Sherman Boutell, of Illinois, brought the hero's name before Congress.

“Jack” Binns has given to the world a splendid illustration," said he. “of heroism that dwells on seas, in many who are in the quiet, unnoticed work in life.

"During the last two days,” said Mr. Boutell, “we have been reminded once more of the perils that beset these that go down to the sea in ships and do business in greater waters. The accident that befell the steamers Republic and Florida last Saturday found heroes ready for the heroic work demanded of officers, men and passengers.

"I believe that every one who read the accounts of the collision and the jeopardy in which occupants of the two ships were placed, and the way in which news reached the rescuers, felt that there was one silent actor in the tragedy whose name should be immortalized.

“I refer to the Marconi operator of the Republic, who had the cool head and steady hand to send forth on the willing wings of air the message of disaster that saved hundreds of lives, and the message of deliverance that relieved thousands of anxious hearts. His name is John R. Binns. He is known to several members of this House."

Mr. Boutell’s address was punctuated with applause, the appreciation of the House being most evident when he mentioned for the first time the name of John Binns.

## Connolly Accused of Cowardice by Ship's Stewards

An unpleasant incident of the Baltic's trip up the Bay was an attack made upon James B. Connolly, writer of sea tales and friend of President Roosevelt, by several stewards of the sunken Republic who charged him with interference during the transfer of passengers last Saturday night. It came, just after the reporters had boarded the Baltic from the United States Revenue Cutter Hudson.

Connolly was giving an interview criticizing the officers and crew of the Republic for inexcusable delay and the unnecessary loss of baggage. He was telling a reporter that some of the Republic's crew acted like cowards, when a passing steward heard him.

"What's that you say? demanded the steward. "You were the only meddler I saw and I don’t care who knows it."

A passenger, whose name was not learned, in the scuffle that followed, cried: “I’ll back up the steward in that."

One of the under pursers bristled up with the statement:

"Don't you dare talk about cowards. You ran around with a life-preserver like a crazy man. You tried to get to the boats ahead of the women, and then tried to excuse yourself as helping your wife and child."

Several attempted to strike the writer who, backed by his brother, who had boarded. the steamer at Quarantine, invited them to come on.

Officers of the ship stepped in and Connolly wwasaS persuaded to go to his stateroom until the ship landed. On reaching the pier Connolly outlined his grievances against the Republic officers in detail.

His chief complaint was that they would not let him get to the Baltic to file wireless dispatches about the disaster, which had been ordered by New York newspapers. He declared that three or four hours were lost in setting about the transfer from the Florida to the Baltic, and that he had been unable to find a reason for it.

Captain Ranson refused to comment on the Connolly matter in any way.

Arthur Bless, publisher of Automobilia, 27an1 Englishman, living in Paris, declared that Connolly had come to be known as “trouble maker.“

General Ives and other passengers excused Connolly’s alleged behavior on the ground that the writer was excited.

## Gen. Brayton Ives Saw Woman Draw Hatpin on Sailor

General Brayton Ives, the banker, one of the few rescued passengers was one of the few rescued passengers who saw - or at least narrated - the disagreeable, unpleasant features o the wreck.

“There was no cowardice, either on the part of passengers or Crews.” General TrIvesey said, "although there was considerable roughness, and, and at times on the Florida, anyhow, a lack of discipline.

“After the collision we all put on life preservers and waited for the end. We heard the wireless working, but didn't realize that it was going to do us any good. Not until the Florida appeared did we feel at all safe.

“Then there was a great lot of confusion. The officers of the Republic paid no attention to family ties Iinn sending off passengers.. The put wives in one boat and husbands in another. Naturally some husbands lashed out and were rough with everybody who stood between them and their wives. I was impressed into service as an oarsman and obliged to make two trips between the Republic and the Florida. It was raining, and everybody got drenching wet.

On the Florida all was confusion. Some of the Immigrants and sailors got to the liquor stores and became intoxicated. The passengers of both ships ran loose around the Florida’s decks without any officers controlling the’. The Florida was dirty, and without any order.

"Then the transfer from the Florida to the Baltic was even more unpleasant. I saw one sailor place his hand upon a refined, delicate women. She struck him a blow in the face and drew a hatpin. He did not again bother her.”

## Woman Author Falls Into Sea; Is Pulled Out by Hair

Mrs. Alice Morse Earl, a well-known author, had the most thrilling experience among the hundreds of passengers transferred from the Florida the Baltic. She said:

“My sister Mrs. Frances Clara Morse, and myself were in the same room near where the Florida tore into the Republic. The log was dense and, the whistle of the Republic was blowing signals continually. We both heard the whistle of the Florida, too.

### Terrifying Grinding Noise.

“I had fallen into a doze, and had awakened when suddenly we felt a jar and then a terrifying grinding noise. In less than ten minutes the lights all went out and we were in complete darkness.

“We hurried from our room and up two fights of stairs to another deck. Everything was in commotion. I want to say, however, that there was no panic and scarcely a whimper on the part of any of the passengers. We heard a couple of steerage passengers sobbing.

“When we reached the upper deck we decided to go back and secure our clothes, but we were not allowed to do so. Then we remained in the darkness awaiting dawn, which was nearly two hours off. It was impossible to find even a candle, and in this suspense we huddled together, terrified, not knowing but each minute would be our last.

“We were told to put on life preservers and await orders. When daylight came we were put in lifeboats and rowed to the Florida. There was no excitement, and all went all right, but when it was found that the Florida had a great hole stove in her bow and that she was only being kept up by the pumps, then our fears again possessed us.

### "It Came My Turn.”

"After much suspense the Baltic was sighted. It was long after dark when the boat I was in, together with my sister, after drifting about nearly an hour awaiting the landing of those ahead of us, approached the Baltic's landing ladder. Several had gotten out and it came my turn.

“A sailor grasped my arm, and at that critical moment ordered me to jump; I knew it was not the right instant, but I obeyed orders, and the next thing knew I was struggling In the water. I felt myself rise to the surface and sink again, but was powerless. Then I felt the boat hook thrust against my back, and the next thing I knew the sailor’s hands were entangled in my hair. I never lost consciousness, and when all were out of the boat I got up and made my way, this time safely, to the Baltic's deck."

### Thought he End Had Come.

Mrs. Morse said:

"When my sister was brought into the lifeboat I did not think she was alive. However, after much of the water had been forced out of her lungs, she suddenly sat up and said, "I'm not dead. "I never saw such an angry sea as that on which out lifeboat was launched. I expected every minute we would be swamped. and when my sister fell into the water I thought the end had come”

Mrs. Henry Howell Armstead, whose daughter is the wife of James Elkins, son of Senator Elkins, had an experience similar to that of Mrs. Earl. She was, however, just about to get into the lifeboat from the Florida when she sank into the water. She was caught before she had been submerged above her knees.

Mrs. Armstead said the first transfer was easy, but the one from the Florida to the Baltic was terrifying. In the part were the two children of Mrs. Davis, Miss Hailie, ten years old, and Master Henry G., seven. The coolness of both was the talk of the passengers.

## SHIPS MAY LOSE WIRELESS MARCONI

### COMPANY IN DISPUTE WITH SEVERAL OCEAN LINES.

### Controversy Has Been Going on for Some Time Over the Payment of Rent, Since Operating Concern Has Found that Losses Are Suffered in the Dull Seasons.

It is posable that collision between the White Star liner Republic and the Italian immigrant carrier, Florida may agitate anew the question of compelling all transatlantic steamship liners to maintain wireless apparatus on board ship. For some time there has been a dispute between the Marconi Company and several of the important lines as to the terms on which wireless plants were to be retained.

Seven years ago, when wireless first came Into popular use, Its promoters anxious to get their system installed on steamships, largely because of the advertising which resulted, and also to shut out. other companies from the same privileges. They offered to put instruments aboard at no cost to the steamship companies, other than the expense of feeding and housing the operators and supplying the electric current.

By this arrangement the wireless folk were to receive all the tolls from private messages, while the steamship company was to be allowed to send official messages free of charge. This idea worked well in the rush season, when liners sailed with full cabins. In the winter months it was different. The steamship companies couldn't lose, under any circumstances, but the wireless company did. The electric current was not an expensive item, and the feeding of two men on a vessel that carried two thousand did not figure up to a sum worth taking into account, it was urged.

As time went on, however, it became more apparent to the wireless company that it was losing money by the arrangement. So it presented its case to the steamship lines and suggested that a yearly rental of, say, $1,000, would serve to guard it from loss. That sum would just about pay the salaries of the operators. Wireless operators, by the way, seldom get good pay, especially men on the foreign vessels.

### Jack Binn’s $12 Weekly Pay.

Men like Binns of the Republic and Tattersall of the Baltic, who figured so conspicuously in the fog-drama off the sand-spit of Siasconset, receive about $12 a week, although, of course, they live on board ship as officers. In the other hand, the ships of the American Line have American operators, who are paid according to the American wage scale, starting at $60 a month. The same rule applies to the American land stations. The head of the Cape Cod station, for instance, receives $125 a month.

To the plea of the wireless company, it is said the steamship lines returned a negative answer. They positively refused to consider the suggestion of paying for the installation of the wireless. At this stage of the proceedings, the Marconi company threatened to remove its instruments and men from the liners, unless its demands were granted. This threat was calmly accepted by the steamship lines. Their reply was, in effect: “Do whatever you please.”

Now comes the ramming of the Republic by the Florida and the drama of rescue in the tossing waste of waters that stretched from the tip of Long Island to Nantucket, in which wireless played the most important part. If a vindication of the value of the wireless were needed, say wireless men, it was afforded by the events of the two days from Saturday to yesterday morning. Those incidents, they contend, prove that no ship is sate without a wireless equipment.

So they are sitting back  in their chairs now, wondering what step the steamship companies will take next. Will they lose the wireless to save $1,000 a year? That is what the wireless men say they are pandering.
