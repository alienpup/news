# RMS Republic News - Scrapbook Page Archive

This repository contains OCR scanned text from the 122 scrapbook image pages in standard markdown format.

## About The Scrapbook Page Markdown

Page Titles are coded as H1 headers; article titles are coded as H2 headers; and minor between paragraph headlines as H3 headers.

Where paragraphs or headers contain a horizontal line separator, the markdown for a horizontal row should be inserted. A horizontal row markdown should be inserted at the end of each page.

The contents of the file republicnews---.md can be used as a template for new page creation. Open the template file at [https://github.com/rmsrepublic/news/edit/main/republicnews---.md](https://github.com/rmsrepublic/news/edit/main/republicnews---.md) copy the content, and paste into your markdown editor of choice.

## About The GitHub Repository (Archive)

As this is a simple archive of the markdown contents of the scrapbook pages, we only need a bare minimum of GitHub features to allow for file storage and revision history (including rollbacks to previous revisions, if necessary).

To that end we will not need separate branches, forks, merging, pushing, and pulling, etc. All operations will be on the “Main” or in our case the “/news” branch.
