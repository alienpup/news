# RMS Republic News - Scrapbook Page Archive

This repository contains OCR scanned text from the 122 scrapbook image pages in basic markdown format.

Page Titles are coded as H1 headers; article titles are coded as H2 headers; and minor inter-article headlines as H3 headers. 

Where paragraphs or headers contain a horizontal line seperator, the markdown for a horizontal row should be inserted. A horizontal row markdown should be inserted at the end of each page.
