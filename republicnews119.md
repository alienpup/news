## Daily Wireless Stories of the Sea Told by "Jack" Binns, Hero of the Republic

### Third Article in Series BINNS, THE "C. Q. D.' MAN Earthquake Told by Wireless.

### How the News of the Great Earthquake in Italy Was Flashed Over the Ocean Immediately After Disaster.

### (Copyrighted, 1909, by the Press Publishing Company.) BY JOHN ROBINSON BINNS, The Republic's Famous  C. Q. D. Man.

"C. Q., C. Q., C. Q.—Earthquake has ravished Italy's boot. Maybe half a million dead. Messina straits wiped out. Greatest disaster in world's history. Old Scylla and Charybdis gone. Stand by-did you feel shocks? F. S.

It was just after sunrise on the morning of Dec. 28. A semi-tropical sun was blistering the upper deck. There wasn't a breath of air stirring. The old Mediterranean was as smooth as glass and the sky serene and cloudless. It was a beauty of a day, had arisen early, for the bunk was beastly warm and the shade of my cage was pleasant and inviting. We were thirty miles out from Genoa and bound for Italy. It was the ill-fated Republic’s last visit to the tropics.

I had lit my pipe, tipped my chair back against the cabin and was drinking in the wonders of the far-off mountain shore line of the Northern Mediterranean when I heard the C. Q. (all ships) repeated thrice.

I dropped my pipe and in a second and answered MKC MKC (Republic.) I was astounded. Clear and crisp came the dot, dash of the above message. It. was flashed from the Marconi tower at Porte Spuria, in Sicily, the signature "F. S." being the code sign of the Italian station.

### Sent News to Captain.

In five minutes I had the Captain over the phone, read the wireless of the catastrophe and sent it down by the steward to be posted on the ship's bulletin board. Five minutes later all the ship's passengers were crowding about. Then came messages to be sent to “F. S.” asking if friends were safe. One inquired for American Consul Cheney and others for merchants En Reggio and Messina. I stood by toy key for a long tine and finally twenty-five miles further on the Republic's call came in my ears. It was very faint. Dark clouds were passing over the ship and the brilliant sun of the early morning was gone. It looked like dawn ever the sea on a moonless evening. It was difficult to get “F. Ss” message:

**"MKC-No details. Whole cities razed and swallowed in pits of earth cracks. Messina and Reggio burning. Can't see. Smoke from burning district clouds everything. Horrible calamity. God pity the poor creatures caught in upheaval. Our office wrecked. Wireless tower may tumble. Help the dying, commiserate the dead. FS.”**

The pious operator Forte Spuria had little need to ask our aid. Almost as soon as the full import of the flash from over the sea reached us Captian Sealby, Officer Willams and others and the Republic's earthquake fund well started. The Republic's contribution was one of the first to reach the stricken cities. It amounted to £55 and was headed by Capt. Sealby.

### Suggests a Fund.

Later I picked up a wave of current from the west, perhaps near Gibraltar. It was a North German Lloyd, giving a stater ship in the sea the news. In part it said:

**"Suggest fund for victims. Mont frightful dead list in world's history. Reaches 300,000. Shocks recurrent. Do you get them? Dangerous to touch territory. P."**

Strangely enough we experienced no disturbances, although passengers sat for sours listening and looking some such shock. None came, but other messages confirmed the first terrible news. As soon as I would pick up a wire I'd have it posted. Thus the Republic’s passengers got quick bulletins from the district and knew what was being done to aid the afflicted

Another read:

**“CQ, CQ—Italy's King and Queen rushing to Messina. Refugees say thousands are pinned under fallen walls slowly perishing from hunger and injuries."**

The Republic's boilers were kept popping until we drew into Naples Bay. Far from the piers we could see the figures of gendarmes and soldiers carrying stretchers. Men were darting here and there along the docks. All Naples seemed to be on the shore. Thousands of the women knelt on the planks with hands outstretched toward heaven.

### Horrifying Scene Unfolded.

It wasn't long before the whole horrible scene was unfolded. Instantly Capt. Sealby despatched a sailor, stoker and a steward to carry ashore the Republic's fund. Here again the Captain showed his calibre in selecting a member of each branch of the service and not strutting ashore himself with the gift. He's aces up for mine.

Honestly. it's impossible to half picture the hundreds of panic and griefstricken Neapolitans who fled in long rows from the gangplank of a refugee ship to scan the faces of the dead and dying as grimy faced soldiers manfully struggled under their countless number of burdens The wounded were writhing under the blankets, and the moans and cries many of them the shrill voices of little children brought tears to the eyes of the few seamen who were forced to remain on board.

Nearly every man jack of us rushed ashore and lent willing and rugged hands in transferring victims from the rescue ship, I got away and joined the crowd and you may bet it wasn't long until I was choking down lumps in my throat and maybe I was crying some myself— I don't know. Believe me, I never want to see such a dock again. Think of those hard faced veteran gendarmes tenderly carting away victims as streams of tears poured Gown their grimy faces. You couldn't keep order in such a place. For all the world you would have thought that a great battle had been fought and that the dead and dying were being brought in. War, its terrors and its hell, never eclipsed that sight!

### Passengers Gave Aid.

Even our passengers for New York, who boarded the Republic at Naples, dropped their luggage aboard and lent their helping bands. The Lord only knows where they sheltered that army of wounded—Naples was turned into a hospital.

We weren’t there long enough to do the poor devils much good, but they got all we had in strength and wealth while we rested there. We came away and pointed our nose to Gibraltar’s gates. All along the route messages flashed over the sea telling of the work of rescue. As contributions were registered and the bulletin posted below I could hear the excited buzz of our passengers and often their cheers. Once into the Atlantic I could make out some of the bulletins sputtering over the Cape Cod wireless station and from nearly all the liners.

So much for the gloomy side of that last visit to the Mediterranean. We had some bully times before we ran into the earthquake wireless messages.

These put a damper on the crew and passengers. But in Genoa we had the times of our lives. There is no game I more thoroughly enjoy than "soccer" or association football. We had a team and a mighty good one, too, aboard the Republic. One day we got a challenge from the University of Genoa.

### Beat the College Men.

Our stokers and seamen beat the college fellows two goals to none in the first game, but their better training told In the second half and they got us 2 to 1, making the final score 3 to 2 in the Republic's favor. I played a half and "Leggie,' our engineer, played a fore. Then the times we had In Genoa's streets. Ever hear a Fufu band play? Well, you've missed something. We had the most expert in captivity. Our players were firemen, seamen and stokers, but every one skilled on his own peculiar instrument, The bass was a butter barrel with ends knocked out and canvas stretched across. The kettledrum was a biscuit tent, and there was A triangle of iron and a tin whistle for cencertina.

Their best piece was "Sons of the Sea," composed by "Leggie," I guess. On Christmas Day we had the great blowout. We paraded Genoa's streets until fully 2,000 people fell in behind our Fufu band. Then the citizens passed the hat and we got 50 francs. Then the boys, becoming more imbued with the Yuletide spirit, entered cafes, and finally got thrown out. Then they lost their way back to the ships.

### Left in a Graveyard.

The plight wasn't a pleasant one, as our shore leave was up. Finally one of those clownish fellows offered to show us the way back to the ship. He took us two miles about streets and over roads and at last drew up in front of high, inclosed ground. Quickly he darted behind the fence. Several of us gave chase. When we got close we found he had left us at a graveyard. He was dodging among the tombstones, and none of us pursued. It took six hours to get back.

## CHORUS GIRLS MOB BINNS.

### Hero of the Republic Wreck Has Exciting Time at the Theatre.

Jack Binns, the wireless operator of the Republic, did show the white feather at the Hippodrome last night. He fled before an onslaught of chorus girls who tried to kiss him. Binns didn't run fast enough. He put up a heroic fight, and when he did escape into Sixth Avenue, bedaubed with rouge and powder, with the chorus girls still pursuing him, even his friends who went to his assistance had difficulty in recognizing him.

His appearance at the Hippodrome was entirely unexpected, both by himself and the audience. He dined last night at the Army and Navy Club, opposite the Hippodrome. as a guest of its officers. and about 11 o'clock it was suggested that the party go over to the playhouse and see the water ballet, which Is the last act on the programme. Just as the act was drawing to a close the spot light was flashed on Bins in the box, and Stage Manager Burnside announced in a loud voice:

“Allow me to introduce C. Q. D. Binns." The audience jumped to its leet. and there were loud yells for a speech. Several of Binn's friends dragged him out of the box an to the stage.

After the cheering subsided Binns bowed. He said briefly that it was no fault of his that he was there, he had tried to escape, but it was not his fault if he could not escape the press agent. Then he thanked the audience and hastily departed.

Binns was standing in a group of about fifty chorus girls while all this was going. As soon as the curtain went down every girl made a rush for him. He was taken by surprise, and in attempting escape he almost fell Into the water tank.

One girl threw her arms around the young man and planted several kisses on his lips, or as near to them Is she could get, before he could shake her off. The girl’s action was the signal for all the others, to imitate. Binns was firmly wedged in the group, but by main force he fought his way clear and darted down the first passageway. It led to the cellar, where the dressing rooms are with loud screams the girls started in pursuit.

## SUIT OVER REPUBLIC'S LOSS

### *FLORIDA BLAMED IN LIBEL BY THE OCEANIC C0.*

### Lloyd-Italiano Replies by Securing an Order Turning Over the Boat to the Court and Staying the Suit—Says the Florida Was Off Her Course.

Litigation to fix the damages for the sinking of the White Star liner Republic on Saturday last commenced yesterday with the filing of a libel against the Lloyd-Italiano steamer Florida by the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company, the owners of the Republic, and the filing of a petition by the latter company for the limitation of liability and the transfer of the vessel to the custody of the United States District Court, wherein the action by the owners of the Republic was initiated. Judge Adams granted the petition of the Lloyd-Italiano company and by so doing he stayed the suit of the Oceanic Steam Navigation Company.

The law firm of Robinson. Biddle & Benedict, representing the company oniing the Republic, which is one of the constituent companies of the International Mercantile Marine Company, filed their bill against the Florida before the admiralty branch of the United States District Court yesterday morning, setting forth an official report of the incidents surrounding the loss of the Republic. Damages in the sum of $2,000.000 were named in the bill. $1,500,000 being claimed as the value of the ship, its equipment, stores and passage money, and the remaining $500,000 covering the loss of the cargo and personal effects of the passengers and crew.

The bill of the libellants sets forth the facts that on the morning of the collision the captain and chief officer were 00 the bridge and double lookouts had been stationed in the crow's nest. Fog blasts were being sounded every minute and a half. At 5:45 o'clock one whistle was heard on the port bow and immediately the order to stop and reverse the engines of the Republic was sent down to the engineer. Full speed astern Was the order given when the loom of the Florida's lights appeared off the port side about amidships.

The facts as set forth by the counsel for the libellants go on to show that the Florida was bearing down upon tho Republic at a high rate of speed, that in an effort to escape the impending blow the master of the Republic ordered full speed ahead and that the Italian steamer, apparently acting under starboard helm, struck the Republic head on with sufficient force to crumple the stem of the Florida for a distance of thirty foot back from the prow.

All the blame for the accident is thrown upon the Florida in the final summing up, which states that she did "not keep a proper course; did not keep out of the way of the Republic, whose course she was crossing; had no sufficient lookout; did not give proper whistles or signals; did not give proper heed to the whistles or lights of the Republic to indicate her changes of helm; was proceeding at an improper rate of speed,” etc.

In the petition for a limitation of liability, which was entered on behalf of the Lloyd-Italiano by the law firm of Wallace, Butler & Brown, it is states that the damaged value of the Florida as she now lies at dock is not more than $200,000, the freight pending amounts to $4,000 and the passage money to $20,000. Besides petitioning the seizure and attachment of the Florida by the court, the plea of the owners was for the appointment of trustee to take charge of the ship and a commissioner to take proof of claims and appraise their value. Oscar L. Richard, one of the agents for the Llord-Italiano, gave bond for the owners to the amount of $24,000. to cover the estimated value of the freight and passage money pending.

The order of Judge Adams granting the petition of the Lloyd-Italiano is in effect an injunction restraining the institution or prosecution of any for damages against the owners of the Florida except in the limited lability proceedings. It now remains for the commissioner to be anointed by the court to determine first, If the owners of the Florida can be held in any lability for the sinking of the Republic and secondly, to what extent that liability carries.

### ”Florida at High Speed.”

"The Florida was tearing down on the Republic at high speed, threatening to strike the Republic a right angle blow amidships. In the effort escape the blow the master put the engines of the Republic ahead; but the Florida came on at a high rate of speed, apparently  swinging under a starboard helm and crashed head-on into the port side of the Republic, penetrating into the engine room. The collision occurred at about 5.50 A. M.,  in lat 40.17 N., long 10 W., being a little more than twenty-six miles south westerly of Nantucket Shoals lightship.

The stem of the Florida struck the Republic's port side nearly a square blow and made a narrow, vertical cur extending well below me water line, straining and starting the bulkheads. Under her momentum the Florida’s bow where it struck the side plating and frames, was crumpled back some thirty feet. The top of the Florida's bow passed above the Republic's side plating, so that it reached and wrecked the cabins along the saloon and promenade decks, causing the death of two passengers and injuring two others. The Republic's engine-room was quickly flooded, and although the bulkhead doors were closed, soundings showed that the ship was settling aft.

“The transfer of the passengers to the Florida, and later to the Baltic, is told, and then the statement continues:

"In the forenoon of the the 24. the Republic was taken in tow by the Revenue Cutter Gresham, the steamship Furnessia towing astern, acting as a rudder, and an attempt was made to tow the Republic, which was still afloat, but very deep in the water, into a place of safety. However, between 8 and 9 P. M. the Republic sank In deep water about fifteen miles west southwest from Nantucket Shoals Light, and with everything on board became a total loss.”

### Blames the Florida.

The loss of the steamship, equipment Lores, supplies and freight and passage money is placed at $1,500,000 and the cargo and personal effects of the master, officers, crew and passengers at $500,000.

The complaint continues.

“The collision and the damage resulting therefrom occurred without any fault or negligence on the part of the libellant or those in charge of the Republic, but were wholly due to the faults of the Florida, In that she did not keep a proper course; did not keep out of the way of the Republic, whose course she was crossing; had no sufficient lookout; did not' give proper whistles or signals: did not give proper heed to the whistles or lights of the Republic; failed by her whistles to indicate her changes of helm; was proceeding at an immoderate rate of speed: did not stop her engines on first hearing the Republic's whistle: did not seasonably take steps to avoid the Republic; did not seasonably slow, stop or back; did not port her helm, but instead starboarded her helm, thereby thwarting all efforts of the Republic to avoid her, and other faults and neglects which will be shown on the trial hereof."

### Queries for Captain.

Attached to the White Star line's libel was the following list of questions that must be answered on oath by the master of the Florida:

First Interrogatory—What was the position of the Florida at noon on Jan. 22? Was that position by observation or by dead reckoning? If by dead reckoning, what was the last previous position that you had by observation and what was the time of such position?
