Sealby and Williams were safe. Rousing cheers were given and it was with the heartiest of warm welcomes that we received the two men on board who had last trod the decks of Republic. The officers of the Gresham and the Seneca are men and sailors in every sense of the word. and too much praise cannot be bestowed upon them for the part the played in the stirring incidents that have just closed and the treatment they accorded us while under their care.

## ”I’m No Hero," Says "Jack" Binns

When "Jack' Binns, the heroic wireless operator of the lost liner Republic, arrived here he made the following modest statement to an Evening Journal reporter:

"It's a treat to me, y'know, to get a good smoke. While I was going through that inferno on the Republic I did not have a single cigarette.

"A heavy fog hung everywhere as we were passing Nantucket, and I was wearied by my long vigil. For almost twenty hours I had had no sleep, and I had just turned in for a little nap when the crash came. The sound awakened me.

"I dressed in a hurry, and when I realized the seriousness of the accident I sent out an appeal for help. I don't know how long I remained on duty, but it seemed an age. I am ready now for a good, long sleep.

"I don't see why they call me a hero. What I did was only in the way of duty, and any other man in my place would have done the same thing."

## SENATE LAUDS WRECK HEROES.

### Resolution at Albany Praising Binns and Ships' Officers and Crews.

ALBANY. Jan. 27.- The Senate adopted a resolution today, which was introduced by Senator Shultz, expressing Its admiration for the heroic services rendered by the Marconi operator on board the steamship Republic after the collision with the steamship Florida, and of the conduct of the officers and crews of the colliding vessels. the steamship Baltic, the revenue cutter Gresham, and the derelict destroyer Seneca. Senator Rains, in speaking to the resolution, said:

“The operator of the Marconi system has been most highly complimented by the press. In response to the compliments extended to him he said, ‘I simply did my duty.' I suppose every officer of that ship did his duty, but there are so many who fall to perform their duty in emergencies that I think it may be well to adopt the resolution, as expressing our appreciation of the fact that there are men in public office and officials and employees of companies charged with the safety of the lives of men, women, and children, who, in an emergency, are capable of overlooking the necessity of taking care of themselves and perform the duties they owe to those in their charge.”

### The Hero of the Republic.

Inevitably there will he more or less of discussion as to whether the commender of the Republic used the best possible judgment, after his passengers and crew had been removed to places of safety, In the measures he took for the saving of his ship. The only interest other than academic and general, which the public has in this dispute, however, is due to the fact that in large quantity of baggage was lost that might have been rescued if he had followed some one of the several different courses suggested to him by men who had none of his responsibility.

It would be seemly, therefore, for the passengers and other landsmen taking part in the argument over this matter to keep clearly in mind the circumstance that theirs is a wisdom that comes after the event after the failure of a course chosen by a man who doubtless considered all the courses open to him before he selected it, and acted as he did with a full realization that upon the outcome depended in large measure his professional future. Having decided, he deliberately staked his own life on the result, and because, Incidentally, he also staked upon it the rate of some trunks is hardly a reason for criticizing him with acerbity, now that the event has proved, not that he could, but that he might, have brought the sinking wreck Into shallow water somewhere by following some other plan.

However this may have been, it remains trie that, high above the many who did their duty faithfully and bravely, stands the figure of Inman Sealby, the hero of the disaster. Much has been said, and properly, about the devotion of his crew, but that was discipline, maintained by the Captain. The passengers have been much praised, and properly, for the self-control and courage they displayed, but that, too, was In great part a reflection of like qualities manifested by the Captain. His little speech from the bridge is described by those who heard It as a masterpiece of eloquence in that it was perfectly adapted in both substance and manner to the end of Inspiring the anxious multitude with quiet confidence. There was no vain effort to bide the facts. The existence of danger was frankly, admitted, but with the admission went assurances of timely help at hand, so convincing In their simple sincerity that women and men alike waited patiently in the cold and darkness till the help came and obeyed every order without a sign of panic.

Capt. Sealby had good material to deal with, but his dealing was as good as the material, and the people who are now moaning about their trunks forget how indifferent they would be to such things as baggage incompetence had stood on the bridge of the Republic, or even if competence there had lacked the tact and force required for controlling a frightened crowd.

## JACK BINNS--$12 A WEEK.

JACK BINNE'S salary was $12 week and board when he was working the Republic. For the fifty-two hours Jack Binns worked on stretch he got no overtime pay. Everything, his services, electrical skill, his courage, his judgment and his endurance, was included in the $12 a week.

While Jack Binns was sending and receiving wireless dispatches from the sinking Republic a member of the Stock Exchange announced that he had made so much money in Wall street that he was going to retire and work no more. He had been a stock broker about as long as Jack Binns has been a wireless telegraph operator. On the Stock Exchange he had cleared up two or three million dollars. Jack Binns had not the money to buy a cigarette or a meal, much less to get clothes to replace those which he had borrowed.

In recent years it has become too common to measure a man's success by the amount of money he has made and to compute his value to the rest of the world by the number of millions of dollars which he has been enabled to get away from other people and keep other people from taking away from him.

Measured on this basis this stock broker is worth three million of Jack Binns.

Measured on the basis of real public service, Jack Binns is worth considerably more than three million stock brokers.

There are many ways of comparing men. One is by how they influence scales. A fat man may outweigh two thin men. Another way is by height. Three tall men may measure more feet and inches than four short men.

Another way is by digestive capacity as displayed at beefsteak dinners and pie-eating contests, or by the number of bottles of wine that a man can drink without lying down on the floor, as in the New Year's eve and election night drinking contests in the White Way lobster palaces.

But the most common way of measuring men's success is by their ability to make money. Rockefeller is the richest man in the United States, therefore he must be the biggest man in the United States, the ablest and the most powerful. J. Pierpont Morgan has got up more and bigger trusts than anybody else, therefore he is a great man. Gauged by this scale, the stock broker who retired with $3,000,000 was not so successful after all, although he showed a great deal sense by quitting before some bigger Wall street man took it away from him.

But measured by their services to mankind, Jack Bins excels them all.

## BINNS SAYS ALL HE WANTS IS SLEEP.

## Wireless Operator of the Republic on His Way to Philadelphia Tells of His AdventurousLife.

John Robinson Binns, Or "Jack" Binns as he will be registered on the role of Immortals, left for Philadelphia just night to consult with theatrical manager who is anxious to have him capitalize his heroism. The nervy youth who manipulated the wireless key on board the Republic was seen before his departure. When told that he would take more than the 'C. Q. D.’ to wake them up over in Philadelphia, he said.

“If it’s as quiet as that over there maybe I’ll be tempted to stay there for a few days and get some rest. They've certainly been sending me over the breakers since I struck shore. I haven’t had a good sleep in a week and I don't expect to get one. I can’t hide any place. And all this because I ripped off a few messages."

"But look at the lives you saved," suggested the reporter.

“But look at my own life," he laughed. saved that too, didn't I?"

Despite the adulation that has been showered upon him Jack Binns has not yet been convinced that he did anything to warrant it. His twenty-five years have been filled with adventure. He was born in Brigg, Lincolnshire, England, on July 4 1884. The date of his debut shows that even at that early age he possessed rare discrimination. He is well put together, but an ill-fitting suit of clothes gives him the appearance of being loosely built.

He has laughing blue eves sheltered by shaggy brows. His forehead is high, his nose inclined to pug, and his chin fairly well set. Just at present it is hard to describe his mouth, as that part of his face has been in perpetual motion, either laughing or talking, ever since he landed here on Tuesday. Next to being an expert wireless operator, laughing is his best accomplishment. His teeth are always in evidence. They look strong enough to get the decision over a boarding-house steak. As to his appetite, he let it be known that he could eat a brick without gravy."

"Tell you something about myself and my family?“ he repeated. Well, we can get through the latter part in a hurry. I'm all there is to the Binns family. My father died a few days after I was born. My mother followed him about a year later. I had no brothers or sisters. After school days a job on the Great Eastern Railway. I was fourteen. I might have been railroading yet if I hadn't been hurt.

I was knocked down by an engine and it was six months before I was able to leave the hospital. While I was recovering I studied telegraphy. When I left the hospital I had eight bones in my pocket which the doctors had presented to me after removing them from my leg. I carried them with me up to last Saturday. They went down with the Republic.

"Since tackling the wireless I've been all over the world. Several times I have managed to be in places where things were doing. I guess it's my luck. I have been mixed up in earthquakes and shipwrecks and I'm wondering what I'Il hit into next. No, I haven t got a girl. What's in that blue envelope? Forget that part of it. I've had that letter a long time. You wouldn't know who she was if I told vou. Just a pretty good friend of mine.”

“What are your plans for the future?”

“To get as much sleep as possible. I have had theatrical managers, newspaper men and photographers chasing me since I hit New York. I know you all mean well, but, honest, I've got a sore throat from talking and my face is cracked from obliging the snapshot men. I have had offers to go in vaudeville, but I don't think I will. So long.”

## JACK BINNS, THE C. Q. D. HERO.

JACK BINNS, the young wireless operator who stuck to his key on the ill-fated Republic for fifty-two hours and by so doing his duty sixteen hundred lives were saved, is being lauded to the skies by the press throughout the world. So, too, we are glad to praise JACK BINNS, not because we admire his brother operators the less, but the lucky chap who made good, the more. But while we are lauding BINNS we should not forget that there is another whose name must also be considered, for without his initiative genius BINNS could not have sent his life saving signals. To MARCONI is due the honor and the glory of the invention of the wireless telegraph, that marvelous device which will save other lives and enable other operators to win the appreciation and the applause of a grateful people until such time as the building of ships shall have become an exact science.
